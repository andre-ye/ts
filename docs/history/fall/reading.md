## *Forced Founders* by Woody Holton 




### Context/Background
- Full Title: *Forced Founders: Indians, Debtors, Slaves, and the Revolution in Virginia*. 
- Published by the University of North Carolina Press on Sep. 1st, 1999.
- Access online version [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5149/9780807899861_holton).
- Notes on Sections 1, 2, and 6


### Notes on Section 1: Introduction

#### Main Ideas
- Nonelites powerfully influenced Revolutionary politics.
  - Virginian gentlemen's struggle to extend freedom were aided by other freedom struggles.
  - The gentry that made the declaration of independence were very interested in the actions of natives, slaves, and smallholders.
- The image of confident colonial elite pushing for freedom is lacking and excludes other groups.

#### Opening Ideas
- Americans like to imagine the colonial elite - Thomas Jefferson & George Washington, to name two - as proud and optimistic leaders; instead, their desperation drove them to the American Revolution.
- Consider **Jacob Hite**, who in April 1774 took desperate measures like: (p2)
  - Crashing down the gates of prisons
  - Placing weapons in the hands of slaves
  - Was one of the wealthiest men in Berkely County, Virginia

#### Example: Jacob Hite

- Hite was the son of a successful land speculator.
- 1760s scheme to gain land from Cherokee Indians
  - Business partner (Richard Pearis) had a half-Cherokee son (George)
  - George asked Cherokees for 150,000-acre land
  - Sold the land to Richard Pearis and Jacob Hite
- Failure of deal
  - British officials feared it may provoke Cherokees to join an anti-British confederation; South Carolina court voided the deal.
  - Left Hite in debt, had property to be auctioned to pay it off.
  - Fall 1773 - price of tobacco sunk to lowest levels ever.
  - Sheriff siezed Hite's slaves and horses to jail (Apr. 12, 1774)
- Reclamation of property
  - Thomas Hite (son) and his gang surrounded the jail and siezed the salves & horses
  - The slaves would suffer if Sherriff recaptured them [^2]; Hite used this to convince and arm slaves against the Sherrif.
- **Debt was a powerful reason to protest Parliament.**
  - Sherriff feared jury would side with Hite:
  > "...it being too general a wish among the people to evade the payment of their Debts and render the authority of [court] Judgements... of none effect."[^3]
  - Virginia courts refused to try suits brought by creditors [^4] against debtors [^5]
    - Temporarily closed to protest Parliament's assault on "American liberty" and to prevent creditors from taking property and freedom from debtors.

#### Hite's story as proof against a faulty historical record
- Surely Hite's story of desperation must not apply to other American figures; Patrick Henry, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson.
- Opposition historical viewpoint:
  - Washington and Jefferson were confident and successful, continuing westward expansion was inevitable given:
    - Slave ownership
    - A solid relationship with British merchants
    - Exercising "almost unchallenged hegemony" over other classes in the province
  - The key to Virginia gentlemen's secure position was a good relationship with small farmers, then
    - Surrounded by farmers, tenants, artisans, sailors
    - Historians question the assertion of gentry [^6] confidence
- It was not that the gentry [^6] 'pulled the strings' of other groups [^7]; each group had leverage but, in complex and perhaps unintentional ways, helped push the gentry towards rebellion. (pg. 4)

#### Definitions
What defines the 'gentry'?
- Owned money, slaves, and land.
- Sat on the House of Burgesses, Executive Council, benches of county courts.
- Fought for capital, labor, and land in each group
  - British merchants over capital
  - Agricultural workers over labor
  - Natives over their land
  

*merchant*
: mercantile firms and transatlantic slave traders in Glasgow, London, and other British ports.

*storekeepers* or *factors*
: employees of merchants located in the Chesapeake.

*traders*
: independent Virginia entrepreneurs.

#### Ways gentry-group interactions shapes independence
- British-gentry-slave relationships
  - Enslaved population grew from 9% to 40% by 1775 [^8]; good news for slaveowners and allowed House of Burgesses to stop importation of slaves [^9].
  - British merchants persuaded Britain's executive body to veto Virginian taxes on every imported African slave.
  - Threat of new slaves + financial damage by London government = support for political independence.
- Late 1774, enslaved Virginians, who hoped to become free, furthered patriotic centiment and aided white Virginians.
- Nonexportation provisions of Continental association deprived smallholders of their export income.
  - Contributed to gentry's decision to make formal declaration of independence.






### Notes on Section 2: Tobacco Growers Versus Merchants and Parliament (pg. 7)

#### Main Ideas
- Many conflicts between tobacco growers and merchants & Parliament spurred the want for independence.
- The Navigation Acts and limitations on trade drastically cut tobacco grower's profits; the price of tobacco fell at least 75%.
- Tobacco Growers and other poorer Virginians increasingly had conflicts with British creditors who came to collect debt, often by taking a large portion of the debtor's property.
- By forcing the Atlantic Slave Trade, Britain economically hurt and destabilized Virginia.
- Taxation without representation was characterized as slavery. Britain has already monopolized Virginia's trade, so they had no right to tax them as well. Even slaves (actual slaves) had the right to own their own money during Sundays and evenings.

#### Opening Ideas
- Robert Routledge, Tuesday, June 3rd, 1766.
  - Lived in Virginia and sold freign merchandise to tobacco farmers.
  - Celebrating Parliament's repeal of the Stamp Act (Virginia courts closed and refused to hear cases)
  - Courthouses would now reopen and Routledge could resume action against debtors.
- John Chiswell
  - In thousands of pounds of debt
  - Son-in-law (John Robinson) died, lent Chiswell money; courts would demand funds be repaid.
- Conflicting attitudes about the reopening of courts and got in an argument at the tavern.
  - Chiswell killed Routledge by sword, then later committed suicide.
- Conflict between creditors and debtors (growsers and merchants).
  
#### On Debt
- Many conflict revolved around debt.
  - Routledge and Chiswell (see above).
  - Jacob Hite's debt drove him to attack the county jail and arm his slaves agains tthe Sherriff.
  - Thomas Swetnam fell so deep in debt his property was exhausted and his children were sold.
- Debt destroyed lives and families, *but also personal independence*.
  - People that loathed debt feel deeper in it.

#### Explanations of Debt
- Wealthy debtors and gentlemen attributed financial difficulties to the cutting out of middlemen dues.
  - Money problems blamed on personal extravagance.
- Convinced British merchants persuaded Parliament to adopt policies that favored their interest and the expense of Virginians.

#### Mercantilism as Slavery (pg. 11)
- In 1760s and 1770s, American pamphleteers often compared British taxations with consent as enslavement.
  - Becoming "the slaves of Britain"
- Virginia slaveholders could not take away slaves' rights to earn money for themselves on evenings and Sundays.
  - The British Parliament, while taking away much, still allowed "us the little we have been permitted to earn for ourselves"[^10].
- Argument: *Britain, which has monopolized Virginia's trade, has no right to tax them as well.*

#### The Argument Against Taxation (pg. 11)
- Taxation as slavery may have been one of the reasons why colonists objected so much to parliamentary taxes that would seem less than in England, Wales, and Scotland.
- Justifications:
  - *Constitutional*. Parliament has no right to taxation because colonists were not represented in it.
  - *Practical*. A master that has already control of his slaves' labor cannot do the same with evening hours.
    - e.g. colonists have already submitted to Navigation Acts. They have shared their wealth to Britain enough.
    
#### The Navigation Act & Limitations on Trade (pg. 12)
- Navigation act: dictates that goods could only be exported from the colonies to England on British forces.
- Exluded Dutch merchantmen from the Chesapeake trade; price of tobacco fell 75%.
- Additional Navigation Act - prohibited shipment of foreign goods to American colonies except through British ports.
- Navigation Acts and fall in tobacco market blamed for social unrest (Bacon's Rebellion 1676 and 1682 plant-cutting riots especially).
- Petitions and criticisms were censured and ignored.
  - This spurred a growing demand for independence from Britain.
- Limited trade only with Britain tied up Virginians.
> Only by making trade free could Virginia render it profitable. -Richard Henry Lee
- Navigation acts blamed for tobacco grower debts and Virginia's trade deficit. [^11]
  - Arthur Lee argued half of Virginia's trade deficit was the result of the Navigation Acts.



- 100% of Chespeake tobacco was shipped to Britain.
- 15% of tobacco was consumed in Britain, the remaining being exported to the European continent.
- The sale profiteer was the British merchant, not the Chesapeake tobacco grower.
- British mercantilism was seen as a "heavy tax upon the colonies" itself.
  - Why make 'double contributions' with parliamentary taxation?
- The Americas gave England raw materials, Britain gave the American colonies manufactured goods.



- Rationale for British taxation
  - Seven Years' War doubled its debt from 72m to 123m.
  - Army officers returning from America told stories of fabulous wealth; British politicans enacted
    - Stamp Act (1765)
    - Townshend Duties (1767)
      - 1769 newspaper writer: "a gift to glind your eyes, whilst they continue to clog your trade."
    - The Navigation Acts
      - Colonial trade helped expand 'British greatness'.
      - 1/3 of Britain's overseas trade was with the American colonies.
      - Navigation Acts as the great guardian of British Commerce (Lord George Townshend)
      
#### Soft Virginian Rhetoric Towards Mercantilism (pg. 15)
 
- Rhetoric against the Navigation Acts in Virginia was strong
- Did not advocate *completely* against a mercantilist system dismantling for reasons mentioned above; economically the British relied on mercantilism to survive.
- Denouncing mercantilism openly would
  - "unite every man in Britain against us." -Richard Henry Lee
  - Turn away powerful British merchants, from which many of the Virginian elite relied upon
- By the end of 1774, most Virginians chose not to demand Parliament to lift restrictions on trade and manufacturing.

#### The Attack on Manufacturing (pg. 16)
- Britain wished to maintain a monopoly on manufacturing.
- Prohibited Americans from making iron and selling hats or woolen cloth outside of their home, shipping utensils in cotton and linen manufactures, among other manufacturing taxations.
- George Washington [^12] resisted the Townshend duties on manufactured goods to avoid dangerous precedent.

#### Increasing Virginian Anti Navigation Acts Rhetoric (pg. 17)
- In summer of 1774, Parliament insisted colonists follow Navigation Acts and new taxes; free Virginians refused to for either.
- Thomas Jefferson: *a natural right to a free trade with all parts of the world*.
  - British merchants ripped the Americans off via free trade and the limited trade of the American colonies.
- Jefferson & Thomas Mason advocated for declarations against the Navigation Acts.
- Most leading Virginians became willing to demand the repeal of the Navigation Acts.



- After Lexington and Concrd, Virginians lost faith in British merchants persuading Parliament
  - Thus, they spoke openly against the Navigation Acts without fear of offending British businessmen.
- Free trade became one of the most important centerpieces in advocating for independence.
- By pitting Virginia tobacco growers against the British merchants, a class conflict in favor of independence emerged.

#### Creditor-Debtor Conflicts (pg. 18)
- Both Virginia tobacco growers and British merchants clashed in creditor-debtor legislation.
- Desperate debtors could become violent, and debt collectors often carried defensive weapons. Imprisoned debtors would burn down jails and attempt to recapture their property.
  - This alarmed the gentry, who believed they could only keep black slaves in check if the white population was completely unified.
- House of Burgesses tried to legislatively protect debtors from British creditors.



- Virginia financed Seven Years' War by printing paper money; value depreciated in relation to pound sterling but did not require Virginia debtors to pay British debts in sterling.
- **Currency Act of 1764** prohibited provincial legislatures from issuing legal tender-paper money which creditors would be legally required to accept in discharge of debts.
- Loan office proposals were thwarted by government officials who did not want to offend British merchants by approving any money.
  - Virginians expected the loan office to pull them out of financial crisis.
- A money shortage meant that debtors often had to pay with property and not money.
  - Debtors often paid double what they owed.
  
#### Forced Immigration of Africans and West Indians into Virginia (pg. 21)
- Another grower-merchant conflict was the forced immigration of Africans and West Indians into Virginia.
- Thomas Jefferson *opposed African immigration*.
  - Jefferson denounced the slave trade in his draft of the Declaration of Independence because it hurt him personally.
    - Inherited debt from the slave trade.
- April 1772 - Jefferson and every member of the House of Burgesses voted to ask George III to abolish the Atlantic slave trade.



- 1767-1796, House of Burgesses voted to double the duty of slaves arriving in Virginia from 10 to 20%.
  - Goal: to curb further slaves, not to increase revenue.
- Motives:
  - Curb the growth in number of Virginia laborers to increase tobacco price.
  - Increase the amont of cash in free Virginian hands to address hte money shortage.
  - Virginian slave sellers wanted to eliminate competition.
  - Remove tobacco growers financing slaves by going further into debt.



- Leading Virginians believed *cutting back slave imports woudl stabalize Virginia*.
  - Slavery required so much capital that other areas like manufacturing projects were neglected.
  - Slavery degraded the value of manual labor.
  - Reduce the chance of slave insurrection plots.
> "Perhaps the primary Cause of the Destruction on the most flourishing Government that ever existed [Rome's] was the Introduction of great Numbers of Slaves." -George Mason, 1765.



- Many richer and older gentlemen had stopped purchasing foreign slaves. 
  - Since they produced slaves through existing slaves having children, they had a monopoly on slaves.
- Less wealthy and younger southern piedmont growers who wanted slaves pressured HoB [^13] into reducing the duty from 30% to 10%.
- Regardless, the HoB tried to limit the trade by doubling the duty and petitioning the Privy Council to end it altogether [^14].



- After rejection, this was blamed on the British slave shippers.
- Only through independence, could Virginia ignore slave merchants and stop the Atlantic African slave trade.
- Conflict between Virginia's gentry class and Britain's mercantile class.







### Notes on Section 6: Gentlemen vs. Farmers (pg. 25)

#### Main Ideas
- The American Revolution is remembered as a confident step - it was actually an act of desperation.
- Independent companies [^15] were favored by the poor farmers for their democratic structure; efforts at militia reform and the creation of a minuteman battalion failed and were met with opposition.
  - The reformation, intended to provide structure to militias and quell unrest, provoked more of it.
- Salt riots formed when the New England Restraining Act took effect as a result of lack of resources; open trade and independence was the prescribed solution.
- Conflicts between renters and tenants broke out, especially in Loudoun.
  - Tenants, suffering under closed export markets, could not pay rent.
  - Paper money was depreciating in value, yet employers paid tenants in paper money.
  - Renters, who were aware of depreciating paper money, demanded other more constant forms of payment.
  - Tenants formed rent strikes and refused to pay. They were often evicted and had their property siezed.
- Military policies were controversial.
  - The discrepancy between officers' and common soldiers' wages were high.
  - The war continued on for too long.
- Virginia and other rebel provinces needed to contact a commercial alliance [^16] to solve these problems.
  - One could only do so with Independence.
- A formal government could better deal with uprising and civilian/military disorder.
  - The fear of disorder was a powerful tool for Independence.

*Note: Apoligies for the briefness of this section's notes. I had written them entirely out, but somewhere in the version pathways the commit got mixed and all the section's progress was lost. Regardless, the main ideas are presented.*

Weekly Reading #4.




### Context/Background
- Written by James Madison, addressed to Thomas Jefferson
- Addressed as "Dear Sir New York Ocr. 17. 1788", Written from New York City.
- Comparison of the function performed by a bill of rights in republican and monarchical systems of government and if it is necessary.
- At this time, the States are adopting the new Constitution and are putting it into action "next March".
- The text contains certain encrypted words that have been decrypted; these were written in a numerical code Madison and Jefferson used for confidentiality.
- Excerpt begins at "*The states which have adopted...*" and ends at "*...will be unnecessarily sacrificed to the many*".
- See footnote [^1] for citations of the excerpt used in class.








### Notes


- Key Points
  - Important question: _what purpose can a bill of rights serve in a republic ("popular government")?_
  - James Madison is largely conflicted in the debate between whether to include a bill of rights or not. He does not see clear indications for its inclusion or exclusion, although he leans towards its exclusion.
  - Main themes: the danger of democracies & mob rule, the circularity in danger of liberty, comparisons between power dynamics of monarchies and republics.



| Government | Political Power | Physical Power | Purpose of Bill of Rights |
| :: | :--: | :--: | :-- |
| Monarchy | In the few [^10] | In the many [^11] | To unite the people, who have the physical power, to rebel against infringements on rights of the people by the few. |
| Republic "Popular" | In the many [^12] | In the many [^12] | Not much purpose; the majority can infringe upon rights of the minority without political or physical repercussions. |


[^10]: (in the monarch.)
[^11]: (in the people.)
[^12]: (in the majority.)



- Controversial proposal in adding a Bill of Rights.
  - Opinion groups:
    - Some want for *further guards of public liberty and individual rights*.
    - Some believe such an addition was not necessary (i.e. it already existed).
    - Some believe such articles were not to be in the Constitution at all.



- **James Madison's Opinion** on the Bill of Rights
  > My [*James Madison*] own opinion has been in favor of a bill of rights; provided it be so framed as not to imply powers not meant to be included in the enumeration. At the same time I have never thought the ommission a material defect, nor been anxious to supply it even by subsequent amendment, for any other reason than that it is anxiously desired by others.[^1]
  - Paraphrase: James Madison is in favor of a bill of rights given that it does not list too many individual powers; he is also fine with its exclusion (not a 'material defect'). Largely neutral in opinion, although later he will provides reasoning against inclusion of a bill of rights.
  - *Believed the Bill of Rights could be of use and "of no disservice" if executed properly*.



- **Issues with the Bill of Rights**/Points of Doubt James Madison writes:
  - There is reason to fear this declaration of individual rights would not be obtained with the lateral support necessary.
    - Rights that are broadly declared will likely be narrowed down in interpretation anyway.
    > "One of the objections in New England was that the Constitution by prohibiting religious tests open a door for Jews Turks and infidels." [^2]
  - The limited powers of the federal government gives the states, ultimately, the most power. This "security", in Madison's language, must be maintained.
  - A declaration of bill of rights causes problems when the government needs control.



- **The Danger of Pure Democracies**
  > "In Virginia I have seen the bill of rights violated in every instance where it has been opposed to a popular current."[^3]
  - Even if an "*explicit provision contained in that instrument for the rights of Conscience*"[^4] were to exist, majorities often 'override' them.
    > "Wherever the real power in a Government lies, there is danger of oppression."[^5]
  - *Often, majorities in the community infringe upon the private rights of the minorities, only because in these cases the government is simply a tool of the majority.*
    - Madison writes that this truth has not been "sufficiently attended to."



- **Comparisons in Power Dynamics of Monarchies and Republics**
  - Republics are superior to monarchies because there is a lesser probability or impact of abuses of power.
    - In Monarchies, power can be exerted from one person to the majority.
    - In Republics, power can be exerted from a majority to a minority.
  - Differences in political and physical power.
    - In Monarchies, the political power is in the hands of a few but the physical power is in the majority. Rebellion, riot, and revolution likely arise.
    - In Republics, the political and physical power are both in the hands of the majority.



- **The Purpose of a Bill of Rights in Monarchies and Republics**
  - What use can a bill of rights serve in popular governments if the majority control both the political and physical power?
  - Two answers Madison provides:
    - When these political truths (i.e. declarations of individual rights) are formally declared and become embedded in national sentiment, they "counteract the impulses of interest and passion."[^6]
    - Sometimes, infringements of power may also come from unpopular and unjust rulers; a bill of rights will be valuable just as it would be in uniting community in a monarchy.[^7]



- **Liberty is a circular, not linear, in danger.**
  - Too much and too little of it is dangerous.
  > "It is a melancholy reflection that liberty should be equally exposed to danger whether the Government have too much or too little power".[^8]
  - The line that divides too much and too litle power is "inaccurately defined by experience."



- **Madison's Concluding Statements**
  - *Absolute declarations of rights should be avoided*, in doubtful or emergency cases.
  - Certain rights, regardless how strong, will never be followed if the majority of the public opposes them, and completely lose their value after repeated violation.
    - The best security against the majority rule is to remove their fuel altogether.
  - Regardless, *there is infinitely less danger of abuse in a republic than in a monarchy.*
    - When power is in the hands of the few, it is natural to abuse it.
    - When power is in the hands of the many, danger is much lesser.
  > "It is much more to be dreaded that the few will be unnecessarily sacrificed to the many."[^9]

### Introduction
- November afternoon in 1821: land that was going to become Lowell, Massachusetts.
  - Merrimack & Concord Rivers, Pawtucket falls.
- Two Boston industrialists: **Nathan Appleton** and **Patrick Tracy Jackson**, selecting site for next textile factory.
  - Reshape the countryside, create a city.
- Lowell was *the showcase industrial city of the North*.
  - "City of spindles".
  - Women flooded into the city to take advantage of:
    - High wages and moral paternalism[^1] of corporations.
- Lowell became an industrial powerhouse.

#### Broader Themes Across New England's Social Fabric
- Lowell was the footprint of the industrial revolution in the United States.
- This revolution also shaped the social fabric of New England.
- Rise of industrial capitalism:
  - Joined wage labor employment.
  - Disrupted traditional gender roles.
  - Accelerated class stratification[^2].
- **Women** negotiated changes - they were the first industrial labor force.
  - Reliance of textile corporations on female labor based on traditional gender devision of labor in textile work.
    - Employed women for the first time outside the home.

- Social horizons were broadened, cultural restraints on mobility strengthened.

#### The Fight for Independence and Social Respect
- Working women of Lowell fought to create independent and socially respected role. (page 2)
- 'Factory girls' fought against gender oppression and labor exploitation.
- Women's secondary social status prevented them from acheiving economic and political rights.
  - Unable to vote.
  - Would face ostracism if they spoke.
- Levied radical critiques of the factory system.
  - Wage labor as 'wage slavery'.
  - Utilized strikes and worker organization.

#### The Historical Contradiction
- Historians put feminist and labor movements in 1800-1860.
- Rarely do texts engage with class *and* feminist methods. (page 3)
- Writings about Lowell and feminism:
  - Confine scope to middle-class suffragettes.
  - Ignore rise of industrialism.
    - Stigmatizes working women.
  - Apply narrow class focus.
    - Labor focus is usually at home.
- Reagan: class and labor plays a part in feminism.
  - Marxists tried to place female workers into the workingmen movement. (page 4)
- **New trend of scholarship:** emphasizes important overlap between Marxist and feminist thought.
  > "This essay is an attempt to move in that direction." (page 4)








### Labor and the Cult of Domesticity
- Begins at page 5.
- In colonial and revolutionary eras, a woman's social status was tied to her labor.
  - Families were the unit of economic production.
  - Gender division facilitated production and accomodated farm life.
    - Men labored on staples of family income (crops),women managed and supplied the household.
  - Women's work was vital to the survival of the home.

- Gender division required mutual dependency. (page 5)
  - Trust: *kept women in respectable positions.*
- Respectability did not change second-class citizenship.
  - Independence was restrained under aspects of society.
  - Women could not:
    - Make contracts
    - Sue in cort
    - Own property
    - Make a will
    - Serve on juries
    - Vote or run for office
- Legal restrictions *have economic implications.* (page 6)
  - Married woman's wages, income, and estate are property of her husband.

#### The Evolution of the Role of Women into the Public Sphere
- Women's evolution into the public sphere: industrial capitalism. (page 6)
- Commercial market expansion & proto-industrial production changed men's and women's relationships with home and work.
- More economical to purchase mass-produced cloth than to make it at home.
- **Freed up women's labor.** (page 7)

"putting out system"
: local merchant-artisans organized distribution of unfinished goods to be worked on at homes and returned to markets for sales.

- "Putting out systems" were at low piece-rate wages but gave women income to contribute.
  - A common practice. (page 7)
- Weaving raw materials: straw for hats, yarn for textiles, leather for shoes.

#### Women's Role in Textile Production
- 1813: Francis Cabot Lowell began textile production in Waltham, Massachusetts.
- Employed a female workforce.
  - Used b/c of their historical role as textile laborers.
  - Cheap and exploitable supply of labo.
- Placed women's work in a modern industrial production and wage-labor relations. (page 8)

- An extremely successful operation.
  - Independent producers to wage laborers: ushered in industrial capitalism.
  - Created the 'permanent factory population'.

- Women were attracted to factory work by:
  - Relatively high wages.
  - A degree of social independence.
  - Promised protection of corporate paternalism.

#### Opposition to Women in the Industrialized Workforce and the Invention of the Cult of Domesticity
- Concern raised over abused English working-class.
  - Lived in miserable conditions and minimal wages.
- Danger posed to the "women's character".
- Lamented changes of coming industrialism.
  - Household labor enshrined as a natural role for women.
  > "Women were the fairer, moral sex whose natural role was the soothe and comfort man." (page 8)
- Vision of a soothing, 'uncorrupted' woman conflicted with women entering labor relations.
  - Amplified class divisions.

- *Cult of domesticity crafted as the antithesis of a working-class creation in America.*
  - Image of 'the lady' emerged.
  - Lower-class women were ignored in the formation of values.

#### Feminism and Activism
- Working women felt that they needed to defend their femininity to counteract their exclusion from domesticity.
- Female factory workers were the most radical:
  - Called for equal rights for women's participation in society and employment.
  - Recognized class-based gender oppression.
- Became organizers around labor and women's rights issues. (page 9)

- Some groups were hostile to women's radical claims of equality.
  - Workingmen framed support or opposition in patriarchal attitudes.

#### The Fundamental Industrialist Goal
- How to use women's low-cost labor whilst not violating social norms about women's proper spaces? (page 10)
  - Created public spaces for women to work in, but limited civic participation.
  - Emphasized employer oversight and control.







### The Waltham System
- Women's social transformation was dependent on the transformation of labor.
- Disurptions laid the foundation for emergence of Lowell and industrial revolution.
  - 1807 Embargo Act
  - 1812 war with Great Britain
- Merchant capitalists looking to spend their money elsewhere with profitable returns.

#### Setbacks and Design
- Worked with partners and investors in Boston to organize a factory system.
  - Each facet of production isolated, but integrated.
- First trial in Waltham, Massachusetts.
- Initial setbacks (page 10):
  - Financing and organizing such a large project.
    - Solved by the 'corporation' legal entity creation.
    - Lowell raised capital and established a hierarchy of authority.
  - Scarcity of labor and stigma of factory work.
    - Derived from the English working-class.
    - Turned to women's labor
- Problem: control.
  - Addressed problems of the 'putting out system'.
  - Concentration of production in one site established control.

#### The Need for Female Labor
- Relied on tradition of women's textile work and low cost.
- Used not only to establish social acceptance of women in the workforce, but to establish **control**.
- Factory work had a reputation of being for those with the lowest intelligence and morals.
  - Males were generally repulsed by factory work; viewed as a loss of independence.
- Industrialists looked at marginalized labor sources to fulfill industrial demand.
- **Solution: high wages and moral regulation.**
- High wages:
  - A mill hand could earn in 1836 from 50 to 75 cents per day.
  - After a week, women could take as much as two dollars.
    - Well over other female professions but below that of average male mechanics.
  - High wages and payment in cash were a sharp turn from the putting out system.
    - Waltham system: utilizing patriarchal traditions of subordinating female labor to a male head.
    
- Corporate paternalism & moral regulations:
  - Attempted to make women's industrial work socially acceptable. (page 13)
  - Boardinghouse system pooled labor of women from isolated rural farms located all over New England.
  - Reassured New England communities that women's moral virtue would be safeguarded.
- Boarding house: protected women's morality by:
  - Locking doors at 10 PM
  - Forbidding unapproved visitors
  - Enforcing church attendance
  - Banning 'improper conduct'

#### Benefits of the Boardinghouse System
- Boardinghouse system solved the two problems: scarcity and widespread public conern about the protection of moral character. (page 13)
- Also benefited employers. (page 14)
  - When one factory girl led her room into the street in a 1836 strike, the matron was fired for not controlling her.
    - Was a check on improper behavior.
  - Exercised complete control over the girls.

- Any worker who ended work had to recieve an honorable discharge to work again in the industry.
  - Company agents shared blacklist.
  - Advocating for change would place you on the blacklist.





### Industrial Women

- Corporations preemptively fired one of the leaders.
- Women used limited organization to the best of their ability.
- Strike:
  - First day of strike: tried to rouse many working women in Lowell.
  - Second day of strike: petition circled that declared "union is power", signed by 1,200 workers who pledged not to go back until wages were restored.
- Unsuccessful strike. 1/6 of laborers in Lowell turned out, and effect on production was minimal.
- Strikers relied on moral persuasiveness and symbolic weight of absence.



- Agitation: corporations raised the cut of the boardinghouses (12.5% wage cut).
- 1836 strike; between 1/4 and 1/3 (1.5k to 2.5k) workers left.
- Women formed a temporary union.
- Successful strike; corporations rescinded fee increase.

#### Political Organizations

  - Bagley attacked Schouler, calling him a corporation machine or tool.
- Schouler was voted out of office.
  - An incredible accomplishment considering women were not allowed to vote.

#### Themes of Revolution Across Strikes
- Issue behind strikes and political actions not the issue of a wage reduction, but status and control.
- Lowell women & labor movement in general **relied on tradition of independence and revolt** dating back to the Revolution.
  - Locke, Wollstonecraft, Jefferson influenced thinking and behavior.
- Women defended positions as 'daughters of freemen'.
  - Directly referencing revolutionary heritage.
> As our fathers resisted unto blood the lordly avarice of the British ministry, so we, their daughters, never will wear the yoke which has been prepared for us . . . [or] yield to the wicked oppressions attempted to be imposed upon us. (page 20)
- Attempted to maintain dignity & independence of labor against corporate encroachment.

#### Criticism of the Corruption of Virtuous and Moral Character
- Argued that public labor eroded women's moral and virtuous character.
- Press criticized women's work and ridiculed women's public actions.
> "The ambition of woman should be to beautify and adorn the domestic circle . . . yet how often do we see them declining to labor in a family, and preferring the quasi-slavery of a cotton factory, the last place in the world, a fashionable female academy excepted, to fit a woman for domestic society and usefulness." (page 22)
- Emphasized need to be 'protected'.
  - Condemned factory system and argued for worker control of production.
- Assumption: women's public industrial work was by nature unvirtuous. (page 22)
  - Factory work a stepping stone to prostitution.
- Illustrates patriarchal attitudes and depth of the "cult of domesticity".

#### A Common Interest Hindered by Gender Prejudice
- Huldah J. Stone. (page 23)
  - Secretary of LFLRA, responsible for selling subscriptions to *Voice of Industry.
- Workingman - sympathetic to objectives of *Voice* but would not take a subscription.
- Stone generally received well in factory towns.
- Workingwomen eventually did win the support of workingmen, but came with condescending and paternalistic attidues.
  - Relationship between LFLRA and NEWA.
  - Spread quickly to Manchester FLRA and Nashua FLRA,among others.
- Leadership in LFLRA even had leadership in NEWA.
  - Bagley as vice president (not president; workingmen's organization needed a male head).
- LFLRA was admitted into NEWA as an auxiliary.
  - Lowell women were careful about presentation.

#### Appealing to Patriarchal Attitudes
- Bagley: asked how girls could help workingmen in arduous battles.
  > We do not expect to enter the field as soldiers in this great warfare: but we would, like the heroines of the Revolution, be permitted to furnish the soldiers with a blanket ormreplenish their knapsacks from our pantries. We claim no exalted place in yourmdeliberations, nor do we expect to be instrumental of any great revolutions, yet we would not sit idly down and fold our hands and refuse to do the little that we may and ought to. We expect to see the revolution commenced, recorded among the revolutions of the past.
- Bagley politely downplayed women's involvement in labor.
  - NEWA struggled to gain traction b/c of debate between mechanics and 'utopian socialists'.
- **Needs of labor support superceded radical feminist ideas.**
  - Choose between class solidarity and allegiance to 'womanhood'.
  






### Corporate Feminity
- Workingmen's groups were hostile to women's full participation, but corporations were completely opposed.
- Corporations: limit women's public participation to work and not politics.
  - Created a **socially accepted place by guaranteeing to exert control.**
  - Set up a highly publicized structure of moral police.

#### Living a Contradiction
- Corporations gave women a relatively high wage and provided a place to be free of immediate family obligations.
- Meanwhile, controlled their labor. (page 23)
- Contradiction:
  - Took independence from public work.
  - Pushed for further gains in social equality and political participation.
- Specifics of feminine morality and women's role in society not important to corporations.
  - As long as women remained a controllable *workforce*, all was fine.

#### Corporate Redefinition of Womanhood and Feminine Morality
- Fit working women into emerging middle-class cult of *true* womanhood. (page 25)
- Emphasized women's **moral and virtuous character.**
- Sought to remove stigma attached to "factory girl".
  - Assured investors that Lowell female workers would not be corrupted and debased.
- Found a place for women outside of the domestic sphere.

#### Employer Control to Resolve Contradiction
- A woman could work in public industrial labor and not violate restrictions of the domstic sphere. (page 26)
  - Contradiction solved by employer control.
- Women maintained virtuous character only through corporate invasion of privacy and rigid control.
  - Boardinghouse system and company firing practices as 2 examples of corporate control.
  - 'Moral Police' of corporations.
- When employees turned to strikes, protests, and petitions, corporations attacked them.
  - Grounds that they were *violating social role as women.*
  - **Redefined public conception of womanhood to align with corporation interests.**
- Corporations directly attacked the feminine identity.
  - Female laborers should attain the corporate definition of a feminine identity.

#### The Alignment of Social Good and Corporate Interests
- Belief that idle young women were prone to depravity.
  - Corporations argued employment was a contribution to public morality.
    - It was *moral* to employ women for 12-14 hour days.
- Controlling the 'social identity and morality' of women also meant quelling strikes.
- Hence, women attacked the capitalistic structure, which promoted sexism to become profitable.







### The Factory Girl
- Recognition that gender and class oppression reinforced one another contributed to chosen identity: **factory girl**.
  - A single, cohesive, rebellious identity.
- Boardinghouses fostered close identification.
  - Close personal and working relationship led to affinity and collective action.
- Networks of sisterhood.
  - Extended kina nd social relations.
- "Factory girl" identity as a synthesis of sympathies of shared sisterhood.
  - Synthesis of "woman" and "worker".
  - Identity of solidarity and support.

#### Increasing Independence
- "Factory girls" gained a level of independence unknown before.
- Mills used mostly young unmarried women.
  - Established them away from families.
  - Paid them comparatively well.
- Women independent of corporations because they were not solely reliant on them for survival. (page 30)
  - Women returned to family homesteads after a term of work.
    - Relied on family & social networks to support independence from corporations.
  
#### An Intellectual Environment
- Women sneaking single pages of books into mills. (page 30)
  - Reading and committing to memory.
  - Circumventing ban of books in the factory.
- Lending libraries sprung up in mills.
- Women questioned their role in supporting slavery, religious and moral concerns, slave-like working conditions.

  - Critiques against working situations in mills, social oppression.
  - Attacking separate-sphere ideologies.
    - Ideology used to limit women's social action and public participation.
  - Wage discrepancy as evidence of gender and labor oppression.







### Conclusion: Working-Class Feminism
- Sarah Bagley: war with oppression in every form. (page 32)
  - Through writings, actions, and creation of identity, women fought back. 
  - Challenged corporate control and women's exclusion from political activity.
  - Working women that controlled the *Voice* could put forward fully articulated working class feminism.

- Transformation of women's labor and socal status in early 19th century linked to rise of industrial capitalism. (page 33)
  - Corporations brought women's work into the public sphere.
  - To create a socially acceptable public work role, utilized traditions of patriarchal control.
- Corporate attempts to include women in the cult of domesticity contradicted corporate femininity ideology.
  - Working women saw and exploited this contradiction.
