### Introduction
  - Communities with conversations about texts are *discourse communities*; a group of people that share basic values and ground rules about communication procedures.
  
  
  
### Discourse Communities as Parlors
  - Academic discourse communities are *ongoing* conversations. They build upon and are informed by what others have said.
    - Conversations go on before and after you come.
  - Academic papers are *similar* to conversations; one may extend, refine, or argue against certain ideas.
    - However, these 'textual conversations' are much slower than face-to-face discussions.
  
  
  
### Why Join the Critical Conversation on Literature?
  - If you major in English, you'll find these practices not defined in explicit terms, but they will envertheless show up in lectures, discussions, essays, etc.
  - If you are not majoring in English, understanding conversations of literary critics will prepare you to join conversations in other discourse communities.
  - Skills of literary analysis help you live a thoughtful, reflective, and ethical life.
    - Interpreting texts helps us understand ourselves and the world.
  
  
  
### Texts and their Authors and Critics
  
#### "Text" in literary and cultural analysis
  - Some distinguish literary works and popular books and films; however, English studies is questioning this.
  - What separates the discourse community of literary studies is not *what* critics say, but what kinds of analysis and questions they use.
  - **text** refers to any literary or cultural work the literary critic analyzes.
  - **literary analysis** is the analysis of all sorts of literature, including contemporary books, movies, TV shows, and stories.
  
#### Author vs literary critic
  - **author** is used to refer to the writer of a primary text.
  - **literary critic** or **critic** refers to person writing the literary analysis of the text.

### Introduction
  - This chapter introduces a strategy that uses materials from outside to help assist interpretation.
  - **Theoretical lens strategy** - critic makes explicit use of another argument or theory to explain a possible layer of meaning.
  - **Theory** - an argument that attempts to explain something.
  - A theoretical text can act as a lens for reading a primary text.
  - Analyses that use the theoretical lens strategy place their explanatory assumptions on the table for readers to inspect and debate.
  - Parts of the strategy:
    1. A theoretical text acts as a lens for discovering arguments in the primary text.
    2. The primary text reflects on the theoretical text by challenging or extending some aspect of the theory.
  
  
  
### Theoretical Lens vs. Context
  - Both theoretical lens and context strategy make use of material from outside text to deepen an interpretation.
  - Difference deals with the type of text cited and the extent to hwich the text is used as a framework for analysis and interpretation.
  - Theoretical lens strategy uses complex explanatory arguments as an interpretative tool.
  - Context strategy uses factual information to inform an interpretation.
  
  
  
### Using the Theoretical Lens Strategy to Brainstorm
  1. **Choose a theoretical lens.** You may read a theoretical text and recall a primary text that illustrates the theory.
  2. **Work to understand the surface meaning of both primary and theoretical texts.** To use the theoretical lens strategy effectively, understand the surface meaning of both texts.
  3. **Re-read the primary text using the surface/depth strategy.** Look for deeper meanings that could be explained by arguments in the theoretical text.
  4. **Reflect on how the primary text differs from the theoretical text.** Does the primary text differ from or extend the theoretical text?
  
  
  
### Using a Theoretical Lens to Write Persuasively
  - It is possible to use the theoretical lens strategy on the small scale by "name-dropping" a theorist or theoretical argument as support for a specific interpretation.
  - More commonly, thereotical lens are used as an overarching frame for the entire essay.
  - To make an extended argument, 
    - name and cite the theoretical text; accurately summarize the text's argument;
    - use the surface/depth strategy to show how deeper meanings in the primary text can be explained by concepts from the theoretical text;
    - support your surface/depth claims linking the primary and theoretical texts with textual evidence from the primary text;
    - reveal something complex and unexpected about the primary text;
    - challenge, extend, or reevaluate the theoretical text for more sophisticated analyses.
  - A theoretical argument must be summarized in the theoretical lens strategy, so it can result in a delayed thesis.
  
#### Common Words Associated with Theoretical Lens
  
  | concept | exemplifies | framework |
  | helps us understand | illuminates | illustrates |
  | is an example of | structure | testifies to |
  
  
  
### Additional Critical Texts
  Common schools of thought for theoretical texts:
  - New Criticism
  - Structuralism
  - Deconstruction
  - Feminist criticism
  - Pyschoanalytic criticism
  - Marxist criticism
  - New Historicism
  - Postcolonial criticism
  - Reader response criticism

### Introduction
  - There are good reasons to draw on published literary criticism.
  - Treat these publications as further turns into conversations about texts.
  
  
  
### Repeating the Conversation vs. Contributing Something New to the Conversation
  - Repeating what a published critic says to bolster your own argument is a legitimate but *limited* function.
  - If you only repeat what others have said, nothng new is brought to the discussion.
  
  
  
### Moving Beyond "Because the Experts Say So"
  - Many experts disagree with each other in temrs of interpretation; thus this is clear one should not take any one interpretation as definitive.
    - The nature of disagreement can be starting point for conversation.
  - Writers recognize they are not the first critics to write on a literary work.
    - The interpretations of other critics are summarized such that the writer of the analysis "speaks back" to these critics.
  - A **summary** distills others' arguments, or describes the situation to which the critic is responding.
  - A **paraphrase** can run longer than the original passage, and it sometimes makes use of language directly from the original passage.
  
  
  
### Entering the Discourse Community of Published Criticism
  - It is important to connect to what others have said, and to say something different.
  - Good conversationalists know how to signal tey have listened, while steering conversation towards their interpretation.
  - Three strategies to connect previous discussions to signalling a new contribution:
  
  | Strategy | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | **Add new evidnece** | Support a claim with evidence others have not mentioned or noticed. |
  | **Add new interpretations** | Interpret the same passages others have interpreted in new ways. |
  | **Disagree with previous interpretations** | Disagreement as a critic can serve as a starting poitn for your own argument as you explain what is wrong with one viewpoint, and defend another. |
  
  
  
### Using the Critical Conversation to Brainstorm
  - Reading arguments by other critics can be a good way to generate ideas about issues, aptterns, or problems worth noticing ina  text.
  - Wait until you have developed a series of questions about a text before you read published criticism about it.
  - Example questions[^1]:
  
  | I have noted some moments in the text that seem significant but I’m not sure how to interpret them. Have other critics made arguments about these same moments? Have they created plausible interpretations? Am I satisfied with their interpretations? |
  | I have noticed a pattern in the text. Have other critics noticed this pattern? Have they made persuasive surface/depth interpretations about this pattern? |
  | I have done some initial research on some contextual references in the text and have some ideas about how to interpret them. Have other critics noticed these contextual details? Have they made similar interpretations? Are there any contextual details that critics seem to be misinterpreting? |
  | I am interested in the socially relevant issues that this text seems to raise. What have other critics said about race or gender or other socially relevant issues in this text? |
  | I am thinking about using a particular theoretical lens to interpret the text. What other theoretical lenses have critics used? Have they used the lens I am thinking of, or might my use of it yield interpretations others have not already made? |
  
  - Having particular questions in mind allows you to maintain your own perspective as you converse with published critics.
  - Sometimes, this means abandoning a particular topic b/c otherds have already persuasively solved it.
  - Read as much published criticism as you can; read carefully for what critics say *and do not say*.
  
  
  
### Finding Published Criticism
  - Most professional criticism is published in journals that can only be accessed with a paid subscription.
  - This means you need to access journals through the library, and not just web searches.
  - Good databases for literary criticism:
    - Literature Online (LION)
    - JSTOR
    - Project Muse
    - MLA International Bibliography
  
  
  
### What If There is Little or No Conversation About a Text?
  - A recently published or overlooked text has little published criticism.
  - Regardless, there are other ways to join the discourse community.
  
  | Join a conversation about other literary texts by the same author. |
  | Look at criticism on the genre and extend those critics' insights to the text. |
  | Look at criticism on texts written in the same time and geographic region. |
  | Book reviews may have literary criticism to offer. |
  
  
  
### Using the Critical Conversation to Write Persuasively
  - Your introduction is a good place to explain how you are adding something new to the critical conversation.
  - Or, respond to critics throughout your essay.
  
#### Remind readers what has been said in the conversation you are joining
  - Conversations in the form of literary analyses unfold much more slowly.
  - A first step is to briefly summarize what has been said before.
  - Make sure you understand the critics you are citing, and use proper conventions for quotations and documentation.
  
#### Distinguish your views from those of the critics you cite
  - Make sure readers can easily distinguish between what is original in an essay and what is a paraphrase.
    - For instance, "Critic A argues X, but **I argue** Y" makes clear Y is your argument.
  - Other ways to distinguish your views from previously published views when adding something new:
  
  | Adding new evidence | Support a published critic's cliam interpreting one part of a text with new evidence drawn from other parts of the text. |
  | Adding new interpretations | Signal to your readers that previous interpretations are valid, but you have discovered another layer of meaning. |
  | Disagreeing with a critic | Using disagremeent as an entryway through which to join critical conversation relies on a surface/depth-contrast strategy. |
  
#### Support your views
  - Focus on other strategies of literary analysis in the rest of your paper and make the case for your thesis.
  - You may want to respond to a specific claim, in which follow the previous steps again.
  - Phrases associated with joining a critical conversation[^1]:
  
  | Association | Phrase |
  | --- | --- |
  | **Adding New Evidence** | Critics have had a lot to say about X, but what they have not noted is Y. |
  | Adding New Evidence | Critics have discussed X, but no one has mentioned Y. |
  | Adding New Evidence | Critics have debated X. However, if we note Y, many of these issues are resolved. |
  | Adding New Evidence | Critics have discussed X but have generally shown little interest in Y. |
  | Adding New Evidence | Critic A has said X about text Y. A similar argument can be made about text Z. |
  | **Adding New Interpretations** | Critic A has said X about text Y. A similar argument can be made about text Z. |
  | Adding New Interpretations | Critics have interpreted X in several ways, but they have not seen this meaning in X. |
  | **Disagreeing w/ Previous Interpretations** | Critics have said X. In this essay, conversely, I will argue Y. |
  | Disagreeing w/ Previous Interpretations | Critic A has said X. On the surface, this interpretation seems plausible. However, if we look at Y, Critic A’s interpretation cannot hold. |
  | Disagreeing w/ Previous Interpretations | Critics have interpreted X as Y. While I agree with X, I disagree that it means Y. Instead, I argue Z. |

  - [Characteristics of a Well-Organized essay](#characteristics-of-a-well-organized-essay)
  
  
  
### Understanding the Role of the Thesis Statement
  - A thesis is a succint statement that summarizes your most important overall argument.
    - It usually makes a surface/depth argument that indicates the complexity of the text.
  - Thesis statements make debatable arguments that define something complex about the texts.
  - Thesis statements usually appear near the beginning of an essay, where they summarize and preview ideas that will be developed.
  - Placing the thesis statement early allows literary critics to make complex arguments that are easier to follow.
  - Argument should pique the reader's curiosity; think of the thesis statement as starting a conversation for the readers.
    - As a writer and critic, anticipate responses and answer them in your essay.
  - Writing a good thesis is not the product of some one epiphany; often it emerges slowly through exploration and analysis.
  
  
  
### Analyzing the Well-Organized Essay
  - Traditional structure for literary analysis:
    - Thesis appears at end of 1st para.
    - Paragraphs of the body develop and support part of the thesis.
    - Final paragraph exttends the argument and answers *'What does this poem mean or illustrate?'*
  - Complex arguments often require more complex structures than the five-paragraph essay.
  - **Reverse outline** - outline written after the essay is written.
    - Read through the essay and write down the main argument of each paragraph.
  - Essays are ordered by *logical progression* rather than sequence of the poem.
  
  
  
### Topic Sentences Aid Recall
  - Research on how readers process texts shows that topic sentences help readers recall what they're read.
  - Topic sentences being paragraphs; this lets readers more quickly remember what they ahve read.
  - Writers will want to ensure their most important arguments appear in topic sentences.
  
  
  
### Developing a Thesis by Freewriting or Reverse Outlining
  - **Freewrite** - essay draft or pre-draft to help write down all thoughts about a text.
    - No editing or censorship: get as much down the page as possible.
  - Afterwards, create a reverse outline to see what major arguments are.
  
  
  
### Developing a Thesis with an Outline-First Strategy
  - Some other critics like to plan carefuly first by preparing outlines for major arguments and topic sentences.
  - Make lists of patterns; help generate a thesis, then add new lists and revise into a more coherent thesis.
  - Crate outlines with milestones or signposts before trying to draft pose.
  
  
  
### Moving Between Drafting, Organizing, and Discovering
  - All strategies move back and forth between reading the text and drafting and organizing arguments.
    - Try out multiple arguments before decidin gon a thesis.
  - Some ideas may be dead ends; move between what you have written and try out new ideas.
  - Be open to new ideas that emerge when you write.
  
  
  
### Characteristics of a Well-Organized essay
  1. Each paragraph in the body of the essay is clearly connected to the thesis.
  2. Each paragraph in the body focuses on a single argument or two closely related arguments.
  3. Each paragraph builds on the previous paragraphs. In other words, the paragraphs are connected to one another but avoid repeating the same arguments.
  4. The essay is ordered by logical progression of the arguments rather than by strictly following the chronological order of the literary text that is the focus of the essay.

  - [Documenting Quotations and Paraphrases](#documenting-quotations-and-paraphrases)
  
  
  
### Introduction
  - One of the criteria for a successful literary analysis is that it must be supported yb textual evidence.
    - Two types of evidence: primary and secondary sources.
  
  
  
### The Quotation Sandwich
  - Think of quotations and textual evidence as a metaphorical sandwich.
  
  | Bun | Present argument | State the main argument the quotation will support. |
  | Lettuce & Tomato | Introduce quotations | Explain where the text occurs; use transitions. |
  | Meat | Quotation | Include only as much text is needed. |
  | Bun | Interpret quotation | Explain why the qutoation is significant. |
  
  - A majority of the paragraph should be the writer's own argument.
  - Repeat key words from the argument to build coherence and emphasize main ideas.
  
  
  
### Good Repetition vs. Bad Repetition
  - When writers repeat the same ideas without adding new information, the lack of novelty is *bad reptition*.
  - Good reptition occurs when writers add new ideas but repeat key words or phrases to help readers follow their thought.
  - As arguments become more complex, *good reptition* becomes important to make your arguments coherent.
  - Good reptition can also involve synonyms.
  
  
  
### Quoting vs. Paraphrasing
  - A paraphrase involves restating the text and its events in your own words.
  - Use direct quotation when the exact wording is important to your argument, and use paraphrase when the exact wording is not central to your interpretation.
  - Some long quotations can include extraneous information; paraphrase and trim quotes.
    - Point the reader in a specific direction of attention.
  
  
  
### Mechanics of Quoting
  - Use present tense to describe what happens in a literary text.
  - If a quotation is longer than 4 lines of text, use long quotation format.
  - Use a slash to indicate line breaks for poetry, and use long form if the quotation si longer than three lines
  - When quoting dialogue between 2+ characters in a play, indent by one inch.
  - Use single quotation marks for the internal quote and double quotation marks for the quote you are using.
  
  
  
### Documenting Quotations and Paraphrases
  - Give readers information to let them find the passage you quoted.
  - An **in-text citation** refers to the page number the quote came from, as well as the author if it is not clear.
  - A **works cited list** provides information for every text cited, alphabetically. 
  ```
  Last name, First name. Title of book. City of publication: Publisher’s name, Year of publication. Format.
  Frye, Northrop. Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1957. Print.
  ```
  - If the text has been republished, include information about original publication and republication:
  ```
  Wordsworth, William. “The World Is Too Much with Us.” 1802. Digging into Literature: Strategies for Reading, Analysis, and Writing. Joanna Wolfe and Laura Wilder. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2016. 156. Print.

  + [Complexity of arguments vs. complexity of expression](#complexity-of-arguments-vs-complexity-of-expression)
  
  
  
### Introduction
  - **Literary analysis** - analytic essays.
    1. Makes interpretative claims
    2. Are debatable
    3. Supported with evidence from the text
    4. Evidence argues for a thesis about the text
    5. Explores the complexity of the test
  - Meeting these five objectives makes an argument valued by literary critics.
  
  
  
### A Literary Analysis Makes Interpretive Claims
  - Greek and Roman rhetoricians categorized arguments into five points of disagreements.
  - **Stasis** - point where the controversy rests.
  
  | **Argument type** | **Explanation** |
  | --- | --- |
  | Existence or Fact | Seeks to establish what facts are depicted in a text |
  | Interpretation | Characterizes a text |
  | Evaluation | Makes a judgement about the text being enjoyable, tasteful, good, bed, etc. |
  | Causal | Investigating impacts of factors on the production of the text |
  | Proposal | Argues an action be taken in relation to the text |
  
  - Most literary analyses' stasis is around interpretation.
  - A literary analysis consists of many interpretative arguments.
  - Primary purpose is to explain what a text is, and what readers should take away from it.
  - Literary analyses **differ from plot/character summaries or book/film reviews** because they focus more on facts or are evaluation judgements (respectively).
  
  
  
### A Literary Analysis must make Debatable Claims
  - Main interpretative claims must be *debatable*; people must be able to *disagree* with your claims.
  - If everyone agrees with each other in the discussion 'parlor', it doesn't make for a very interesting one.
  
  
  
### A Literary Analysis Supports Arguments with Textual Evidence
  - Arguments that take risks are valued, but must be backed by evidence.
  - What is counted as 'evidence' depends; look towards context.
    - For literary scholars, most important sources of evidence are from the text itself.
    - Careful interpretation & analysis of direct quotation are valued.
  - Furthermore, explain evidence that may seem to contradict you argument instead of leaving it out.
  
  
  
### A Literary Analysis Argues for a Thesis About the Text
  - A literary analysis makes a series of interpretative claims; yet the critic must *connect claims into a **thesis** about the text*.
  - A thesis requires looking a the meaning of individual elements of a text to make a bigger picture.
    - What messages does the text communicate?
    - What is the author trying to say?
    - What does the text reveal about cultural and societal influences in which the author was working?
  
  
  
### A Literary Analysis Explores the Complexity of the Text
  - Literary analysis assumes that literature is complex, and that texts prevent a web to be untangled.
  - Highlight how the text under discussion offers complex messages.
  
  
  
### Complexity of arguments vs. complexity of expression
  - Don't use complicated words or other inflation devices to make a simple argument seem artificially complex.
  - It is the argument, not the expression, that should be complex.
  - A well-written argument allows for readers to follow a complex concept with little difficulty.

### Introduction
  - Discussing strategies to argue about texts that literary critics use when writing analyses.
    - These help critics make claiims that define what a text means and are debatable, supported w/ evidence, and complex.
  - These strategies can reveal multiple layers of meaning.
    - Mental places to go to for discovering an argument: **topoi**.
  
  
  
### What is the Surface/Depth Strategy?
  - Central strategy of literary analysis: **surface/depth**; finding deeper meanings behind the surface interpretation of a text.
    - A critic points out multiple layers of meaning; from the surface to deeper in.
    - Link these layers - surface and the depth - to make an argument about the *full* meaning of the text.
  
  
  
### Using Surface/Depth to Brainstorm
  - **Surface reading** - what readers notice readily in a work.
  - Getting a sense of the text's literal meaning may be challenging, like changes to language over time.
  - Consider many possibly conflicting ideas about possible deeper meanings to a text.
    - Some initial ideas may be implausible or dead ends.
  - Considering several layers of meaning can help you better imagine counterarguments to the analysis you settle on.
    - It can also allow for a more complex interpretation, accounting for several layers of meaning.
  
  
  
### Using Surface/Depth to Write Persuasively
  - Literary scholars use surface/depth to discover and develop possible interpretations; this process *can be messy*.
    - The surface/depth strategy moves from a reading strategy into a literary analysis of the poem.
  - Use two variations for presenting surface/depth claims in a literary analysis.
  
#### Using the surface/depth linking strategy
  - Link a surface reading to a concept, idea, or thought not stated explicitly in the text.
    - This is a **deeper interpretation**, it is not immediately obvious.
  ```
  In "Morning Song", *motherhood* [surface] is *represented* [link] through *images of emptiness* [depth] that *indicate* [link] a *loss of the mother's self.* [depth]
  ```
  - Common verbs used to link surface to depth:
  
  | appears | connotes | figures | illustrates |
  | indicates | is | masks | means |
  | represents | reveals | seems | shows |
  | signifies | stands for | suggests | symbolizes |
  | underlies | | | |
  
#### Using the surface/depth contrasting strategy
  - Contrasts a simplistic reading of the text to a more complex reading.
  ```
  Initially, "Morning Song" seems to be a loving tribute to motherhood [surface reading]. However [contrast word], a closer reading suggests that the speaker is significantly troubled by the baby [deeper reading].
  ```
  - Contrasting can start turning conversation by showing disagreement over the interpretation of a text.
    - Implies you can make a complex argument about the text that requires explanation and support.
    - This is the goal of literary analysis.
  - The contrasting argument will delay the thesis until the second or even third paragraph of the essay.
  - Common words used to contrast surface-level and deeper readings:
    - *Characterizing a surface reading*: appears, at first, may, seems
    - *Introducing a deeper reading*: although, but, even though, however, now, while
  
  
  
### Plausible vs. Implausible Readings
  - Surface/depth can be used in more and less persuasive ways; how to use this strategy persuasively is challenging.
    - The more surprising and nonobvious the interpretation, the more potential it has for literary analysis.
    - However, critics must provide plausible reasons.
  - Good evidence can be found in quotations and paraphrases.
  - Surface/depth arguments **must be faithful to the surface meaning of a text**.
    - You can clarify howo your deeper meaning connects to and enhances the surface meaning.
  - **Symbol-hunting** is an attempt to force a text to fit in an interpretation.
    - It can be more reductive than complex because it shuts down the meanings truly contained in a text.
  
  
  
### A Note on Persuasive Interpretations
  > "Well, that's my interpretation." "It's a poem, so I can read into it whatever I want."
  
  - Such is not the goal of literary analysis; the speaker rejects the communal nature of literary analysis.
  - An interpretation that is closed to others has no obligation to the text or to be credible and persuasive.
  - Surface/depth offers credible and persuasive reasons that allow readers to better understand the text.

### Introduction
  - The **patterns** strategy involves highlighting motifs, or reoccuring elements in the text.
  
  
  
  
### Using Patterns to Brainstorm
  - Patterns can be used both before and after developing a surface/depth claim.
    - Beforehand: come up with plausible & complex surface/depth arguments.
    - Afterward: improve arguments.
  
#### Using the patterns strategy before a surface/depth argument
  - Note repetitions and recurrences throughout a text; work to make sense of possible deeper layers.
    - i.e. an image, a word, or a sound; locate instances surprising to others on a second or third reading.
    - The device does not need to reappear the same way every time for it to be recurrent.
  - Mark repititions in the margins of text, then brainstorm ideas about what they may mean.
  - There are no hard rules about what types of reptitions you may find; just be curious about any reptition you see and a deeper meaning it may reveal.
  
#### Using the patterns strategy after a surface/depth argument
  - If you have already developed a surface/depth argument, you can use the patterns strategy to discover evidence to support this argument.
  - Think of the surface/depth claim as rough; be open to revising claims about what a further reading of the text revelas.
    - Use the patterns strategy to take notes in the text that may support the interpretation.
  
  
  
### Using Patterns to Write Persuasively
  - Patterns and surface/depth go hand-in-hand; a persuasive use of patterns must connect multiple examples of a pattern w/ a clear surface/depth interpretation.
  - To use the patterns strategy effectively, a critic
    - provides multiple pieces of evidence—quotations, paraphrases, or summaries—to illustrate a pattern
    - connects the evidence illustrating the pattern to a surface/depth argument
    - shuttles back and forth between evidence and argument
    - usually begins with the most obvious example and moves to the least obvious
  
  - Phrases used to introduce a patterns argument:
    > throughout, often, repeatedly, frequently, recurrently, many examples, many times, several instances
  
  - Phrases used to connect multiple examples in a patterns argument:
    > again, moreover, furthermore, additionally, also, another example, similarly, further, even, finally

### Introduction
  - One of the main strategies of a literary analysis is finding a deeper meaning.
  - The overall goal of a literary analysis is to show complexity in a work.
  - This chapter will overview aspects of texts that literary critics pay attention to when generating patterns and surface/depth arguments.
  
  
  
  
### Character Descriptions
  - Character analysis should not be the goal of the essay, but information about the people in literary texts is a good starting place for analysis.
  - Good questions to ask:
  
  | How are the characters physically described? |
  | What language is used to describe the character's actions? |
  | How do the characters talk? What does this reveal about the character? |
  | What actions are performed by the character, especially ones with potentially contradictory motives? |
  | Do the names given to the characters have significance? |
  | Is there a clear protagonist or antagonist? What interpersonal conflicts are there? |
  
  - Look careful at character descriptions and brainstorm as many surface/depth arguments as possible.
  - Don't censor; first list out possible arguments, then reject interpretations with limited support.
  
  
  
### Setting
  - The physical and social environment a text is set is different from the *context* (environment in which the text was written).
    - Both are important to consider, though.
  - Good questions to ask:
  
  | Is the time, like time of day or year, significant in any way? |
  | Is the location meaningful? Has the space been described in a revealing or suggestive way? |
  | How does the weather or climate impact the deeper meaning of the story? |
  | What is the spatial relationship of objects? e.g. are they claustrophobic or open? |
  | Is anything revealing of furniture or decorations of the setting? |
  | Is the lighting significant? |
  
  
  
  
### Perspective
  - It may be helpful to identify the viewpoint from which the text is told.
  - Paying attention to shifts of perspective can help in finding surface/depth arguments.
  
  | What biases does the narrator or speaker have? |
  | What are the implications of the reliability of the narrator? |
  | How broad or limited is the narrator's perspective? |
  | Are there shifts in the narrator's perspective? |
  
  
  
### Comparisons
  - The author can use comparisons to describe events, objects, or people.
    - These transfer a set of ideas associated with one object to another.
  - Comparisons always have two parts - a subject being described and a set of concepts being transfered from the original object.
  - Comparisons do not need to be explicitly stated.
  - Good questions to ask:
  
  | What metaphors or smilies does the text use? |
  | Is the text an allegory for something else? |
  | Do comparisons in the text seem to reverse typical, standard meanings? |
  
  
  
### Ironies
  - An irony involves a tension between an expected state and the real state.
    - e.g. a firehouse burning down is an irony.
  - Three types of ironies;
    - *situational irony* - tension between expected and actual situations.
    - *dramatic irony* - an incongruity between what the audience knows and what a character believes.
    - *verbal irony* - conflicts between the literal meaning of a phrase. 
  - Good questions to ask:
  
  | Does the text suggest a tension between our expectations and what actually occurs in the text? |
  | How do these ironies shape our understandings of central meanings, themes, and ideas in the text? |
  | What surface/depth arguments can be made about these tensions? |
  
  
  
### Time and Sequence
  - Looking at the way text plays with time or a sequence of events can trigger fruitful ideas about a text's possible meanings.
  - How does the sequence of events change order through flashbacks, flash-forwards, etc./
  - Questions to ask:
  
  | Does the etext call our attention to the passage of time? |
  | Does the text speed time up, or slow it down? What do these time changes indicate? |
  | Does the order in which events are presented differ from the actual chronological order of events? |
  | What verb tense is used, and do these tenses shift? |
  
  
  
### Titles and Epigraphs
  - Titles and epigraphs (brief quotations from another text as a rpeface) as clues to interpreting deeper meanings.
  - Questions to ask:
  
  | What does a title and epigraph suggest about deeper levels of meaning? |
  | What research can you do about the title to uncover deeper meanings? |
  
  
  
  
### Specific Words
  - Words that are unusual or expected, or repeated should be probed further.
  - Good questions to ask:
  
  | What are the denotative (literal) meanings of the word? |
  | What are the connotative, emotional, or cultural meanings of a word? |
  | How does the author make up words or play with grammar? |
  | Are words repeated, or is there an unusual pattern? |
  
  
  
  
### Sound
  - Reading a text aloud can help you hear reptitions, or other aural aspects.
  - Some poems are intended to be delivered orally.
  - Sound-related issues to look for:
  
  | **Alliteration** is repition of an initial consonant sound. |
  | **Assonance** is the repitition of vowel sounds. |
  | **Consonance** is the reptition of ending consonants. |
  | **Meter**  is the basic rythmic structure of a poem. |
  | Are sounds of words suggestive? Are there homophones? |
  | Do patterns of rhyme or repeated sounds link ideas? |
  | Is the meter or rhyme pattern broken? |
  
  
  
### Breaks and Groupings
  - Line, chapter, stanza, and scene breaks can provide groupings and separations to analyze.
  - Look for:
  
  | Does punctuation call attention to itself? |
  | Is there significance to where a scence ends? |
  | How do stanzas operate as units of meaning? |
  | Is there an enjambment (breaking of a line) in the poetry? |

    * [Common Words and Phrases Associated with Context](#common-words-and-phrases-associated-with-context)
    
  
  
### Introduction
  - Literary critics value interpretations on how a text is complex.
  - One productive strategy for discovering complex interpretations is to look for opposites in a text.
  - Interpretations that break down opposites are valued in literary studies because they influence how we see the world.
  - Searching for arguments about opposites in a text is usually productive; this search usually leads to other insights to help you find a complex argument about a text.
  
  
  
  
### Opposites and Irony
  - Irony occurs when two states or meanings are in tension.
  - Irony *exposes tensions*, but the opposites strategy breaks down these tensions, and changes how we see the concepts.
  - The opposites argument may begin by noting an ironic tension, but goes further to produce a more complex argument.
  
  
  
  
### Using Opposites to Brainstorm
  - Look for concepts, ideas, patterns, characters, or settings that appear to be in tension.
  - Common opposites or tensions:
  
  | life/death | natural/unnatural | male/female |
  | strong/weak | self/other | inside/outside |
  | youth/age | love/hate | truth/deception |
  
  - A **binary opposition** can provide a productive starting place for looking for complex arguments in a text.
  - Many binary oppositions have a *hierarchy*; i.e. one of two terms is vieweda s superior to another. 
    - For example, natural is superior to unnatural, truth is superior to deception.
    - Arguments using the opposites strategy can complicate these generally simplistic hierarchies.
  - Things we identify as opposites *can often have many similarities*.
    - Noticing these similarities help us discver complex arguments.
    - One can look towards what something is not to define what it is.
  
  
  
  
### Using Opposites to Write Persuasively
  - When critics use the opposites strategy, their arguments usually have several steps.
    1. Note oppositions as a tension in the text (usually through surface/depth).
    2. Provide textual evidence that elaborates on these tensions.
    3. Explain how the text subverts a normal way of looking at these opposites.
  - A **paradoxical statement** is an assertion that may seem to be self-contradictory but also appears to contain a truth.
  - Paradoxes call attention to competing value systems; they show how neither set of values is absolute.
    - They can challenge how we see the world, and cause us to reflect more deeply.
  - Paradoxes enable us to argue for the **social relevance** of our analyses.
    - Social relevance is the assumption that life and literature are connected.
    - Literature can help us understand our contemporary social situation.

### Introduction
  - A close reading interprets text through careful, close attention to details.
  - The next chapters iwll focus on strategies to take attention beyond the text at hand while still contirbuting to the ultimate goal of interpretation.
  - Context may involve looking up references to events, people,a nd other works to create surface/depth arguments.
    - Or, researching social/cultural context a text was written in.
  - Using the context strategy may require bringing in external help.
  
  
  
### Common Types of Contextual Information
  - Common types of contextual information include information about
    - historical period or culture a text was written in;
    - cultural references within a text;
    - the historical meaning of particular words used in a text;
    - other texts mentioned or alluded to in the work
    - other writings byt he same author or his/her contemporaries
  - Critics can also bring biological information about an author to support an argument.
    - however, use biographical information sparingly to avoid making causal arguments, which can distract from the goal of interpreting a text's meaning.
  
  
  
### Using Context to Brainstorm
  - The context strategy involves making connections to knowledge from many swathes.
    - It often appears in the form of notes to look something up, or to research something later.
  - Wonder about the significance of items, terms, and other aspects of the literature; then find out more about them.
  
  
  
### Finding Contextual Information
  - Researching to find potentially useful contextual information requires some imagination and curiosity.
    - Follow up on hunches and leads, and abandom those that don't end up working out.
  - Finding contextual information using general web searches
    - Search engines can turn up a plethora of information, and getting useful results will take time.
    - Remember to cite your source afterwards.
  - Finding contextual information using library databases
    - Campus libraries and library websites cna serve as portals for excellent contextual information inaccessible from ordinary web searches.
    - By searching for scholarly peer-reviewed articles on, for example, *JSTOR*, one can find accurate and detailed sources.
  - Finding contextual information using the *Oxford English Dictionary*
    - *OED* provides not only definitions but an evolving history of the meaning of words over time.
    - Many college libraries provide access to *OED* online.
  
  
  
### Using Context to Write Persuasively
  - Context is used most effectively when it
     - Supports a surface/depth argument;
     - Contains only as much information as is needed to support the argument;
     - Correctly cites information that is not common knoweldge;
     - Illustrates the complexity of the text.
  - Common words used with context:
  
  | anachronistic | contemporary | context |
  | contextualize | cultural | genealogy |
  | historical | historicize | intertextual |
  | political | situate | social |
  
  
  
### Options for the Scope of the Context Strategy
  - Context can not only be used to elaborate on a specific symbol or reference, but to bolster larger arguments.
  - Can help support patterns strategy by showing another way the text reveals a pattern or recurrent meaning.
  - Using context strategy in a large-scale scoep can lead to a choice to delay stating the thesis.
  
  
  
### Context and Authorial Intension: Productive Tensions
  - What role should an author's intensions play in a critic's analysis of a work?
  - Recent critics argue one needs to understand history to join the uathor's intended audience.
  - Contextual details often ensure a critic does not completely ignore an author's intensions.

### Introduction
  - Considering a text's genre is an important application of a context strategy.
  - **Genre** is at term that refers to categories used to group similar texts.
  - Texts grouped in a genre share similar purposes, audiences, and conventions.
    - They can, however, differ in how important these three elements are.
  - For example, a poetic elegy has a specific purpose of lamenting loss or death, and cann have a specific convention requiring couplets be written with an exact meter.
  - Some genres:
  
  | Broad | poetry, fiction, drama, nonfiction, comedy, tragedy, history |
  | Poetic | elegy, sonnet, ballad, ode, dramatic, monologue |
  | Popular | romance, mystery, horror, western, courtroom, drama |
  
  - Information about genres can be used to make surface/depth arguments.
  - Many genres discussed are really **verse forms**, or a poetic structure consisting of patterns in rhyme, meter, or lines.
  
  
  
### Making Arguments About Genre
  - Genres contain particular historical and cultural associations.
  - Similarly, when reading a sonnet, we read it in the context of other sonnets.
    - A **sonnet** is a fourteen-line poem arranged in rhyme schemes.
    - Typically, there are ten syllables per line.
  - Arguments about genre are persuasive when:
    1. They support a clear surface/depth interpretation;
    2. Do not contain extraneous information;
    3. Follow proper citation practices;
    4. Make an argument about the genre.
  - There may be contrasts between a piece and its genre that can be analyzed.
  
  
  
### Using Genre to Brainstorm
  - Begin by identifying the genre or genres of text you are analyzing.
  - Arguments about genre are significant when the author *breaks* or *disrupts* conventions of the genre. Think: what do you expect from the genre?
  - Questions to ask yourself about a genre:
  
  | **Cultural associations** | Who usually reads and writes this genre? Is it associated with an ethnic or social group? |
  | **Subject matter** | What kinds of subject and content matter does one expect to find int he genre? What conflicts does the genre include? Are there common themes or motifs? |
  | **Purpose** | Does the genre have a purpose, like to celebrate or mourn? Does it convey a moral? |
  | **Style and tone** | Is the genre dark or light? Does it use elevated diction or plain speech? |
  | **Characters or speakers** | Are there "stock" characters typically found in the genre? Are there common personality traits? |
  | **Settings** | What settings does the genre usually take place in? |
  | **Rhythm, meter, and rhyme** | Is the genre associated with a particular rhyme scheme or meter? Is there an order or pattern the genre is supposed to follow? |
  
  - Next, focus on elements that are missing or seem out of place.
    - Ommitting or changing a common feature associated with the genre;
    - Using the genre to raise subjects or themes usually not associated with it;
    - Combining elements of multiple genres.
  
  
  
### Using Unfamiliar Verse Genres: The Sonnet
  
#### What is a sonnet?
  - Sonnet originates from Italian, and means "little sound" or "little song".
  - Characteristics of sonnets:
    - Fourteen lines;
    - Follows a defined rhyme scheme;
    - Typically written in iambic pentameter (five pairs of stressed & unstressed syllables per line);
    - Expresses a single theme or sentiment;
    - Has a shift in sentiment.
  - Example of iambic pentameter from SHakespeare's Sonnet 129:
  
  ```
  ˘   ´    ˘     ´    ˘       ´   ˘   ´    ˘  ´
  Is per jur'd, mur derous, blood y, full of blame
  
  ˘ = unstressed
  ´ = stressed
  ```
  
  - Some flexibility is acceptable; e.g. "mur-derous" needs to be pronounced as two syllables for it to work.
  
#### Petrarchan and Shakespearean sonnets
  - There are two main variations of the sonnet form.
  
  | | **Petrarchan** | **Shakespearean** |
  | Named after | Franceso Petrarca | William Shakespeare |
  | Formation | Eight-line octave with ABBA ABBA rhyme scheme and six-line sestet with flexible rhyme - usually CDECDE or CDCDCD. | Three groups of four lines (quatrains) and a pair of lines (couplet). Rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. |
  | Structure | Two parts of the sonnet form an argument; octave describes the problem and sestet proposes a resolution. Ninth line creates a turn. | The third quatrain or the couplet contain an unexpected sharp term; summarizing the theme of the poem and introducing a new look at it. |
  | Subject matter | Unattainable love | Love and its torments, time, the immortality of poetry compared to the fleeting beauty of youth. |
  
  
  
### Using Genre to Write Persuasively
  - Genre is used effectively when it
    - Supports a surface/depth argument;
    - Contains only as much information about the genre as is needed to support the argument;
    - Illustrates the complexity of the text.
  
#### Common Words and Phrases Associated with Genre
  
  | breaks from | contradicts | overturns |
  | plays with | subverts | surprises |
  | unexpected |

  - [How Social Relevance Works with other Strategies of Literary Analysis](#how-social-relevance-works-with-other-strategies-of-literary-analysis)
  - [Criticism Changes Over Time](#criticism-changes-over-time)
  
  
  
### Introduction
  - All literary and cultural analyses work to draw out multiple levels of meaning to show its complexity.
  - However, there is a secondary value of literary analysis: **social relevance**.
    - Life and literature must be connected in some way.
    - Literature, regardless of when it was written, can offer wisdom to our modern situation.
  - You can write a good literary analysis without indicating social relevance, but many critics do so.
  - A first step towards social change lies in exposing social problems and power relations.
    - An argument invoking social relevance gives **exigency** (motivation) for literary analysis beyond simply interpreting the text to broader problems and forces.
  - Social relevance usually appears most clearly in the final paragraphs of the essay.
  - Using social relevance can work in two ways:
    1. Inform topic choice or what to look for;
    2. A strategy to draw out in the essay to show how a work is socially relevant.
  
  
  
### Using Social Relevance to Brainstorm
  - Prominent topics and concerns in literary scholarship:
    - Gender, race, ethnicity, class, etc.
    - Oppressed and marginalized groups participating in thier own oppression
    - Nationalism or national identity, postcolonial works
    - Power and power struggle
    - Interpretation to understand our position in society
    - Boundaries between self and other
    - Relationships between past and present
    - Relationships between human and natural
  - Think of connections between the text you are analyzing and one or more of these topics.
  
  
  
### Using Social Relevance to Write Persuasively
  - Critics are more explicit about the contemporary social relevance in their concluding paragraphs.
  - They "step back" after persuading readers to see new layers of meaning in text.
    - e.g. by combining an argument about self and other with a statement on consumer culture, the analysis becomes socially relevant.
  
  
  
### How Social Relevance Works with other Strategies of Literary Analysis
  - Social relevance works hand-in-hand with other literary analysis strategies that have been discussed.
  
  | **Surface/depth and social relevance work together.** | Social relevance needs to uncover nonobvious complexities in a text. |
  | **Patterns and social relevance uncover social problems embedded in a text.** | Problems can be uninetended by the author, or reoccur throughout the literary work. |
  | **Context and social relevance show how a text reveals something about culture/society.** | Utilizing social relevance can connect contextual information into a socially relevant point and continued legacies of the past. |
  
  
  
### Criticism Changes Over Time
  - Prior to the 20th century, literary criticism was focused on biography or linguistics.
  - Early 20th century, **New Criticism** advocated for interpretations that focused on only the text and its meaning.
  - New membership into English studies began to diversify; new works and methods of interpretations were considered and aopted.
  - Modern literary criticism no longer treats texts as isolated objects, but instead parts of a network of social forces.
  - **Criticism will continue to change.**
