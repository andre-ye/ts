The ending of the story is on page 271 of the PDF; it follows that halfway lies at $$\frac{271-185}{2} = 43$$ pages. The middle of the story is thus at $$185 + 43 = 228$$.







### Section 1
Begins page 179 (PDF: 187)

- Awakening with the female narrator; she is not in the bed she has lain down in. She is in concerning health.
- Transition from "she" to "I" from the first paragraph to the second.
- The narrator's possessions "have a will of their own".
- Much has happened in this house; births, deaths, laughs, anger.

> "Nothing is mine, I have only nothing but it is enough, it is beautiful and it is all mine."
> Page 180 (PDF: 188)

- Narrator is embarking on some sort of journey; she is pondering which horse she should take.
- The narrator rides Graylie - the selected horse - as a stranger rides beside her.
- The scene "backs out" to reveal Miranda has been dreaming this; Miranda awakens with the word "War" in her mind.
- Miranda begins to think about Liberty Bonds.
  > A Liberty bond (or liberty loan) was a war bond that was sold in the United States to support the Allied cause in World War I. Subscribing to the bonds became a symbol of patriotic duty in the United States and introduced the idea of financial securities to many citizens for the first time.
  > [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_bond){:target="_blank"}







### Section 2
Begins page 183 (PDF: 191)
- The day before, there had been two people at Miranda's typewriter.
- Miranda nods at two men sitting at her typewriter; the older man inquires why Miranda has not bought a Liberty Bond.
- Nervous and fearful, Miranda is faced with the hostility of these two men over the war and Liberty Bonds.
- Miranda attempts to explain that she has no money, but the two men make a patriotic justification that even the poor can contribute some money.
  - Internally, Miranda describes the war as a "filthy" one.
- Miranda begins to arrange her letters and notes clumsily as she is lectured by the two men, who finally leave.







### Section 3
Begins page 188 (PDF: 196)

- Miranda has a burning headache as she takes a bath.
- She supposes that the headache had begun with the war.
- Mary Townsend (Towney) - the Society Editor who runs the Ye Towne Gossyp column.
  - Townsend and Miranda have much in common and like each other.
  - Townsend is hysterical about something.
- Prior, Towney and Miranda were real reporters; after they suppressed a story requested by the covered subjects and a rival newspaper published it, both were degraded to routine female jobs.
- Towney is desperate about not being able to pay for Liberty Bonds; Miranda sympathizes with her.
- Miranda goes to join a group of young women that raise money for men in cantonment hospitals.
  - This group was going to cheer up injured soldiers.
- The narrator mentions that they should do everything to make them contented, but that the narrator will not talk to them, even if there is war.
- Miranda moved among the young women; there was a grimness even amidst the girlish laughter.
  - Miranda is embarrassed at "the idiocy of her errand"; she walks along aisles in the hospital bed.
- Finally, Miranda spots an injured man that looked back at Miranda with an unchanged, "hostile" face. Miranda places down flowers, sweets, and cigarettes and hurries outside.
- She looks through a window and spies on that injured soldier; she could not identify what walks of life he had come from.
  - Miranda quietly notes that it was lucky for her to find him, rather than a talkative man.
- Although Miranda and another girl dislike this, they cautiously mention that it is "alright".



- Adam was in Miranda's mind often; his image was always pleasantly present.
- Miranda would need to raise $50, lest she endures the results of her failure or refusal to buy a Bond.
- Uncomfortable with her messy and unpleasant appearance, she vows not to let Adam see her like this. She puts on perfume and a jacket.
- Adam and Miranda go to walk outside on this fine fall day.
- Adam is tall, heavily muscled in the shoulders, narrow in the hanks and waist; he is 24 years old, a Second Lieutenant in an Engineers Corps.
- Miranda recalls that Adam did look like a "fine healthy apple" that morning.
- While Adam boasts he has never had pain, Miranda quietly knows that she has had too many pains to mention.
- Miranda has worked for three years in a morning newspaper.
- Adam received an extension of leave because of this "funny new disease"; Miranda comments it is like a plague as a funeral procession passes.
- Miranda is eating very little; she tells Adam that "there's something wrong".
- Adam's leave is almost over; Miranda vows to meet with him again that night and leaves.
- Miranda ran upstairs and looked back from the top at Adam, who was looking back.







### Section 4
Begins page 205 (PDF: 214)

- At her desk, Miranda pretends to read letters.
- Towney and CHuck Rouncivale (sports reporter) are talking.  Towney finds it ridiculous that many believe the disease was caused by diseases brought from a German ship to Boston.
- Miranda wished to stop hearing or talking, and only to think about Adam, but there was no time.
- Miranda had first seen Adam ten days ago; they had been to many places together.
- Towney offers in a patriotic voice to volunteer; Miranda rebukes that she would just "stay at home"; Chuck argues "women should keep out of it".
- Chuck would often pay for hooch (alcohol); Bill is "raging about... like a stag".
- Miranda is told about a hoofer looking to get in a physical altercation with the writer of a critical piece on a production (Miranda), who expresses hope that they have gone.
- Miranda meets a "little drab man in a derby hat" (Danny Dickerson) that gives Miranda newspaper clippings for her to reconsider her critical article.
  - Danny is concerned that shows in the far East will equate the word of a "tanktown" (unimportant/small town) critic with that of a metropolis.
  > "They don't know that the more high class an act is the more the hick critics pan it."
  > Page 213 (PDF: 222)
- Miranda internalizes this sharp altercation but is comforted by Chuck.







### Section 5
Begins page 215 (PDF: 223)

- Miranda has invited Chuck to a show for a newspaper entry; internally, she begins thinking about the end of *something*.
- Miranda laments that she wishes the war were over.
- Chuck begins writing the review; meanwhile, he responds that he does not care how the war starts or when it ends, as he will not be there.
- Miranda begins to think about women and men in the war; bread will win the war. Housewives make themselves busy and feel useful by believing silence and quiet will win the war.
- After the show is over, Miranda looks at Chuck's writing, agreeing to sign it under her name, but insists that Bill knows Chuck wrote it.
- Does anybody here believe the things we say to each other?







### Section 6
Begins page 219 (PDF: 227)

- Miranda waits for time to pass.
- Time proceeded with a certain eccentricity; hard flashes of light, twilights.
- Miranda felt a wish to see him again and a threat of not seeing him gain.
- Miranda rushes to Adam who is standing on the sidewalk; her head was like a feather.
- The play the two watched was long and dreary; after the third act was a Liberty Bond salesman making a pitch for Liberty Bonds, to the chagrin of Miranda.
- In the street, Miranda and Adam lit cigarettes and walked slowly.
- Miranda claims that the salesman was another "nasty old man who would like to see the young ones killed"; "potbellied baldheads" that know they are safe but are sending off Adam.
- Adam responds that they cannot do anything but talk and that it is not their fault.
- Miranda discusses "what war does to the mind and the heart"; such impact is worse than scars on the body.
- As Adam tells Miranda that he must go to war, Miranda reflects that Adam, the "sacrificial lamb", was flawless, pure, and complete.
- Adam waited for her in The Greasy Spoon, a restaurant next to the pressroom. She knew that Adam would not live to grow older.







### Section 7
Begins page 225 (PDF: 234)
- Adam pulled chairs together around the restaurant; they listened to the orchestra.
- Miranda wanted to break Adam from his dream and to "save each other".
- Yet, she remained silent and danced with Adam.
- Miranda notices a nearby couple that is both, to an extent, miserable; they "looked into the hell they shared". Miranda envies the girl.







### Section 8
Begins page 228 (PDF: 236)
- Miranda knew she had been asleep for a long time; suddenly, Adam walked into her room.
- Adam was called back to camp for inoculations.
- Miranda was visited by the doctor and given medications.
- Miss Hobbe is horrified at Miranda's suggestion that she may have influenza.
- Miranda begins hallucinating; she hears voices clamoring of "Danger" and "War".
- Adam has Miranda's medicine; he comments that the shops and restaurants are closed and that the streets are full of funerals and ambulances.
- Adam attempts to call St. Luke's Hospital with no luck.
- Miranda continues to vomit.
- Adam builds an ablaze in the fireplace; afterward, he and Miranda recite prayers to keep Miranda from falling asleep.
- Miranda and Adam begin singing "Pale Horse Pale Rider," sung by blacks in the oil fields in Texas and the cotton fields.
- Adam and Miranda tell each other they love them; Miranda sleeps.
- In her sleep, Miranda has another dream in which Adam is shot by arrows but rises each time, unwounded and alive. When Miranda threw himself before him, though, the arrow cut through Miranda and Adam, killing Adam.
- Miranda suddenly awakens as Adam runs into the room.
- As Adam leaves to get coffee and ice cream, two alert interns at the County hospital had arrived to take her away.
- Miranda is carried out of bed by Dr. Hildesheim.







### Section 9
Begins page 219 (PDF: 227)

- At the hospital, Dr. Hildesheim informs Miranda at her request that Adam has left a note and gone again; Miranda bitterly responds that she does not believe him.
- Miss Tanner reads the note that Adam has left.
- The busy hospital scene blurs in Miranda's eyes into towering white walls and dark figures.
- In another vision, two executioners move towards her, pushing an old man; Dr. Hildesheim is a skull wearing a German helmet carrying a bayoneted naked infant.
- Miranda awakened suddenly, cursing at Dr. Hildesheim; she immediately repents for them.
- There it is; death, there is nothing to fear; it is only eternity.
- Resubmerged in a vision, Miranda sees the beauty in nature and faces of pure identities. Yet, in this serene setting, Miranda feels a sense of apprehension, distrust in their joy; pain returned as she confronts death.
- The cloth was drawn away; she sees Miss Tanner filling a hypodermic needle.
- Miss Tanner suddenly alerts Miranda that it is Armistice; the war is over.
- Miranda, "ungrateful" and still hostile, was greeted every morning by Miss Tanner.
- Yet, Miranda could not see the light; she remains depressed and in a state of sickliness.
- Chuck and Towney come to see Miranda; they bring flowers and letters.
- As Miranda reads the letters, she reads that *Adam has died of influenza in the camp hospital*.
  - This had happened one month ago.
- Miranda begins writing down things she needs; she seems significantly more active.
- She was "not quite dead" now; she would return and be at home again.
- Adam was there, invisible but present in the room; Miranda leaves.
- No more war, no more plague; "there would be time for everything."
