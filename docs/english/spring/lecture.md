## Navigating a Post-Truth World: Charles Sykes

- "What did you give us?" Benjamin Franklin: "A republic, if you can keep it."
- Do we really believe in warnings of the end of the republic?
- We are not immune to history.
- Most Americans are not sure they have faith in democracy.
- Historically, Constitutional democracies/republics are not the norm.
  - Tribalism, authoritarianism, oligarchy, monarchy, tyranny were the default settings of human culture.
- Liberal democracy is the antidote and the answer.
  - Needs the rule of law, checks and balances, respect for the minority.
  - **Responsible citizenship.**
- Crisis with democracy stems from a crisis of citizenship.
  - More than a third of Americans cannot name a single right in the First Amendment.
- Being a citizen, though, is more than just knowledge.
  - A respect for truth; truth is the oxygen of democracy.
  - Democracy requires a functioning maketplace of ideas; the truth is knowable and we live in a shared reality.
  - The glue of democracy is trust in one another.
- Politicians who lie and rely on propaganda are not new; what is new is a citizenry that hears lies, knows they may be lies, and don't care.
- If we *don't have a shared reality*, politics becomes about brute force and there is no discourse.
- The first casualty of win-or-lose politics is *truth*.
- Prior, we did have guardrails in politics, but they limited the impact of the most reckless voices in our politics.
- Now, we are awash in conspiracies, doctored videos, lies, propaganda, sometimes from the highest areas of American life.
  - What do we do about this?
- Fake news is *completely fabricated* news: lying works.
  - Generates clicks, ratings, votes.
  - Lying can be a very profitable business model.
- George Orwell wrote extensively about the relationship between truth and democracy.
- Gary Kasparov: the point of propaganda is not just to mislead, but to attack your critical sensibilities in an effort to annihlate truth.
  - Make you question who you believe and what truth is.
- When no-one know what is true or real, people look towards the state.
- Truth is essential to our politics these days.
- Everything is possible and nothing is true: the public gets to a point where they will believe the worst, regardless of if they are being lied to.
- In a silo, a fake story is impossible to refute: alternative reality silos are safe spaces in which they are protected from information that challenges their premises.
- We deligitmize much of the fact-based media and destroy immunity to hoaxes.
- It is not fair to completely blame the media; tweaking human nature is difficult.
- A lot of us assume that humans use their minds to determine what is true.
  - If you understand the tribal nature of human beings, you will understand people strengthen their bond to their tribe.
  - A hyperpartisan that hears information about their party or candidate will get dopamine, meaning it is *addictive*.
  - If humans want to believe something, they only need one piece of information.
- In a world where we ar eone click/swipe away from having all of our biases confirmed.
- We are paying a tremendous price for our failure to educate young people in media literacy and civics.

## The Politics of Fiction: Elif Shafak

- Strasbourg, France - born to Turkish parents.
- Raised as a single child by a single mother.
- Two different kinds of womanhood: mother and grandmother.
  - Spirituality, education, rationality
- If you want to destroy something, all you need to do is surround it in thick walls.
- We are born into a certain cultural circle.
  - If we have no conneciton with other worlds, we will dwindle inside our cultural circle.
- It's not healthy for a human being to spend too long in front of their own reflections.
- We form clusters based on similarity and produce stereotypes about other clusters of people.
- Storytelling can allow us to transcend these walls.
- Writing fiction - less of an autobiographical manifestation as it is a transcending.
- "Representative foreigner" - each person seen as a representative of their nation.
- Imagination - the only suitcase you can keep; stories keeps one centered.
- In the face of death and destruction, differences evaporate.
- If you manage not to be frightened by the gap between the mind and the tongue, it can be stimulating.
- Stories lose their magic when a story is seen as more than a story.
- Many want to see a manifestation of identity in stories; the world of identity politics affects the way stories are circulated.
- Non-Western authros feel identity politics the most; writers are seen as representatives of their background.
- Freedom of imagination is in danger by idnetity politics - multicultural literature, all non-Western literature is lumped together.
- Multicultural writers are expected to tell "real stories"; function is attributed to fiction.
- Fiction - "just a story"; the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics.
- Identity politics divides us; fiction connects.
- Stories cut across boundaries.
- "Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance."
- Problem is not knowledge; it is knowledge *beyond* ourselves.
- Fiction is both local and universal.
- Imaginative literature not necessarily about writing what we "know", but instead writing what we can "feel".

## Remembering Rachel Carson with Kaiulani Lee

- Silent Spring was published in 1962; an alarming story of pesticides.
- The chemistry industry hit back against Silent Spring.
- Carson opened a ferocious debate.
- Our technologies come with destructive effects.
- Kaiulani Lee's mission - bringing Rachel Carson to life. Performs a play, called "A Sense of Wonder".
- The backlash allowed for much more publicity than the book would have gotten.
- Immersion into nature - what are the voices that you hear? What is the sense of wonder?
- Carson was very poor, unbelievably poor; yet, she changed the course of history.
- Carson was an aspiring writer that later fell in love with science; Carson worked for the wildlife service.
- Biologist by day, writer at night; it is the study of science that makes the literary career possible. 
- Rachel Carson had already become one of the most recognized scientific writers before the publication of Silent Spring.
- Science does not belong only to a few; we live in a world of science, and the aim of science is to discover the truth, as is literature.
- Write as a merging of poeticism and science; science will discover the poetic qualities.
- No one can write truthfully about the sea and leave off poetry.
- Not a muckraking journalist as an observer and poet of the natural world. In her life, she changed.
- Atomic energy horrified Carson.
- Science promised the people of the 1940s chemicals to kill domestic pests.
- Carson did not want to write Silent Spring but needed to; setting out to look for any information that may help.
- Carson was alarmed by the indifference of many; citizens assumed that there was some guardian of these operations.
- No publisher would publish an article for fear of retaliation from chemical advertisers; Carson decided to write a book.
- Carson's mother was dying and Roger needed Carson's attention, but she decided to write the book. No one else would write the book - this was an urgent matter.
- Only years as a government scientist gave Carson the knowledge to understand the severity of the use of chemicals.
- The public was unknowingly being asked to take the risk - the public must make the choice, and they cannot make the choice if they do not have the information.
- "A Fable for Tomorrow" - the future American town in which all the sounds of Spring have been silenced. The Silent Spring.
- Silent Spring was a phenomenal success - the public was riveted; Silent Spring also became the target of political controversy.
- Argument against Carson: we would return to the dark diseases, with vermin and diseases. Carson was accused of Communist sympathies, "mystical", and being a "peace nut". There is an initial irritation, but perhaps it will become amusing.
  - Interesting use of "science" and portraying Carson's work as "mystic" and kooky.
- The book incited a very small but rich portion of society; Carson became a publicity problem.
- Rachel Carson, to the public, was calm and confident in her convictions.
- Carson was also dying of cancer; every month is precious.
- The nature of responsibility and of life. "To sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards out of men." -Lincoln
- One more trip into the public arena.
- Silent Spring had awakened the public; President Kennedy set up a special panel to study pesticides, and their report vindicated Silent Spring's thesis. Followed by Congressional hearings examining legislative action
- A new consciousness was formed in our balance with nature.
- Carson died in 1964.
- Natural beauty has a necessary place in the development of any individual. Destroying natural beauty degrades some part of man. Earth is exceedingly beautiful; in it, we can find calmness and courage.
- Mankind has tread into an artificial world; away from the realities of Earth. (Reminiscent of Shafak)
  - *Intoxicated by his own power*; experimenting with his destruction.
- But, the more clearly we understand the realities, the less we will destroy it.
