- For scientific enterprise to be successful, scientists must clearly communicate their work.
- Process. *Each step of the way requires communication.*
  1. Present preliminary results for comments from collaborators.
  2. Report results in a presentation at scientific meeting.
  3. Final report prepared in scientific paper format and submitted to publication.
- Components of a scientific paper
  - Title - statement of question or problem
  - Abstract - short summary and preview of paper
  - Materials and Methods - exactly waht you did
  - Results - presenting the data
  - Discussion - interpret and discuss the results
  - References Cited - books and articles used
  - Acknowledgements - in recognition of any assistance used

## Successful Scientific Writing
- Writing should be **clear** and **concise**.
  - Avoid overly descriptive and flowery language.
- Write in short and logical sentences.
  - Avoid long introductions and run-on sentences.
- Write for your audience.
  - Think about your audience's skill level and goals.
- Support writing with evidence.
- Locate sources related to work early.
  - Spend time to rephrase sections in your own words.
- Avoid using quotations.
- Do not plagiarize.
- Use past tense in the Abstract, Materials & Methods, and Results sections. Use past tense in Introduction and Discussion when discussing your work; use present tense when relating background information.
- Use the active voice when possible.
- When referring to scientific name, italicize or underline the genus and species.
- Pay attention to rules for numbers (0.153, not .153)
- Include a heading for each section in a scientific paper.

## Locating Appropriate References
- Primary sources - reports of original research. Conference papers, dissertations, technical reports, etc.
- Secondary references - textbooks, review articles, provide an *interpretation* of research.
  - Reference section can be used to find primary sources.
- Effective search strategies with online databases, indexes, adn search engines.
  - PubMed, Google Scholar, Biosis Previews, Science Direct, JSTOR, Science Citation Index, Web of Science
- Stop after each section of reading a paper and summarize essential points in your own words.

## Plagiarism
- Plagiarism is the use of someone else's words or ideas without acknowledging the source or author.
- All sources of information *need to be acknowledged* (even if content is paraphrased).

## Writing a Scientific Paper
- Title Page and Title
  - Must include name, course title, lab section, instructor name, due date.
  - Title page specifically formatted.
- Abstract
  - Summarizes information being investigated, methods used, results, and conclusions.
  - <= 250 words, if possible.
  - Composed after the paper is completed.
- Introduction
  - Dual purpose:
    - Provide context for investigation.
    - To state the question and hypothesis tested.
  - Provide background information.
- Materials and Methods
  - Describe your experiment such that it is replicable. 
  - Describe what to include and what not to include.
  - Be as specific as possible, but do not try to justify procedures or include troubleshooting.
- Results
  - Most central and important part of a scientific paper.
  - Four components:
    1. 1 or 2 sentences reminding reader about nature of research.
    2. >= 1 paragraphs describing results.
    3. Figures (graphs, diagrams, pictures)
    4. Tables.
  - Draw the attention to important results.
- Discussion
  - Analyze and interpret results of the experiment.
  - Restating the results is not an interpretation.
  - Provide context for understanding the significance of results.
  - Results **do not prove** a hypothesis, it confirms or negates it.
- References Cited/References
  - Inclusive list of all references used in paper.

## Oral and Poster Presentations
- Include components of a scientific paper
- Briefly describe the experimental design and only **essential procedures**.
- Emphasize results in bold and clearly label figrues and tables.
  - Discuss and interpret results.
- State conclusions.
- Be prepared to answer questions.

**Suggestions for delivering effective presentations**
- Slides should have a small number of bullets (<= 6).
- Use a simple and consistent template or theme.
- Do not simply read the slides; describe the points.
- The objective is to **clearly communicate your ideas**.

**Suggestions for presenting a poster**
- Use minimal text and maximal visual impact.
- Include sections of a scientific paper.
- Use large font for headings and content in abbreviated format.
- Use simple, bold, clearly labeled figures and tables.
- Consider use of fonts, color, and images.
- Be prepared to answer qeustions and discuss your work.
