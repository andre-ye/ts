## Introduction
- People have known that during sexual reproduction, a male reproductive cell (**sperm**) and a female reproductive cell (**egg**) unite in **fertilization**.
- The formation of **gametes**explain why each gamete has half the usual number of chromosomes.
** Meiosis** is a nuclear division that leads to a halving of the chromosome number.
  - Ultimately leads to the production of a sperm and egg.
  
## 13.1: How Does Meiosis Occur?
- To understand meiosis, we must first understand ideas about chromosomes.
- Consider this observation:
  - Each organism has a *characteristic number* of chromosomes.
  - e.g. your cells have 46 chromoomes, dogs have 78, some ferns have 1000.

### Chromosomes Come in Distinct Sizes and Shapes
- American cell biologist Nettie Maria Steven, 1906.
- Found that although a specific fly species had 8 chromosomes, there were *five distinct types*.
  - In males, two chromosomes (known now a `X` and `Y`) were *unpaired*.
  - In females, there was a pair of `X` chromosomes (and no `Y` chromosome).
- `X` and `Y` chromosomes are **sex chromosomes**; any other chromosomes are **autosomes**.
- Chromosomes that are the same size and shape are **homologous chromosomes** (also referred to as **homologs**).
  - A pair is a **homologous pair**.
  - Contain the same gene in *the same positions* along the genes.
  - However, are *not* identical.
- A **gene** is a segment of DNA found at a place in the chromosome that influences a trait.
  - e.g. chromosome 2 in *Drosophila* contains a gene that influences eye color.
  - An **allele** is a *version* of a gene.

### The Concept of a Ploidy
- Stevens identified the fruit fly **karyotype** by identifying the number and types of chromosomes present.
- Many organisms (including humans) have *two version* (homologs) of each chromosome; these are **diploid**.
  - One allele is carried on each of the homologs.
- Bacteria, archaea, etc. have cells that contain only *one type* of chromosome, called **haploid** ('single-form').
  - Have only one copy of each chromosome; an individual has only one allele of each gene.
- **Notation used by biologists:**
  - *n* represents number of *distinct type* of chromosomes in a cell, called the **haploid number**.
    - In humans, *n*=23.
  - For sets of chromosomes, use *2n*, *3n*, etc.
- The number of chromosome *ets* is the cell's **ploidy**.
  - Diploid cells are *2n* because there are two chromosomes.
    - **Maternal chromosome** from the mother and **paternal chromosome** from the father.
    - Note that in human, *2n* = 46.
- **Many species have >2 types of a chromosome.**
  - These are **polyploid** ('many form').
    - Polyploid species can be triploid (*3n*), tetraploid (*4n*), hexaploid (*6n*), octoploid (*8n*), etc.

### An Overview of Meiosis
- Cells replicate each of their chromosomes before starting meiosis.
- An unreplicated eukaryotic chromoome begins as a single, long DNA double helix wrapped around histones (proteins).
  - DNA is replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle.
  - Replicated chromosome consists of two **sister chromatids**.
  - Each sister chromatid contains an identical copy of the DNA double helix.
- An unreplicated chromosome is never called a chromatid; it is only used to describe an individual chromosome after replication.

#### Meiosis Consists of Two Cell Divisions
- Back-to-back cell divisions occur in meiosis, **meiosis I** and **meiosis II**.
- Homologs of each chromosome pair are separated in meiosis 1.
  - Homologs go to respective daughter cells.
- At the end of meiosis I, each daughter cell has **one** of each chromosome instead of two.
  - (half as many chromosomes are the parent cell).
  - Diploid parent cell produces two haplooid daughter cells.
  - Note: each chromosome still has two siter chromatids.
- During meiosis II, sister chromatids of each chromosome separate.
  - Sister chromatid becomes an individual chromosome (called daughter chromosome).
  - Each daughter cells has one copy of the daughter chromosome.
  - Sister chromatids separate into daughter chromosomes during meiosis II.
    - Note: this is what happens during mitosis.
- Chromosome movement during meiosis I and II:
  - ...depends on microtubules of the **spindle apparatus**.
  - these attach to the **kinetochores**.
  - are located at the **centromere** of each chromosome.

#### Meiosis I is a Reduction Division
- Reduction of chromosome number in meiosis I makes the division different from meiosis II or mitosis.
- Original cell entering meiosis is diploid; four daughter cells are haploid.
- Some or all haploid daughters go on to become egg cells or sperm cells.
  - Process of **gametogenisis** ("gemete-origin")
- When two haploid gametes fuse during fertilization, the chromosomes form as diploid cells again.
  - Resulting diploid cell from *fertilization* is a **zygote**.
  
### Phases of Meiosis I
- Meiosis is a set of continuous events.

#### Early Prophase I
- Nuclear envelop breaks down, spindle apparatus forms.
- Siter chromaetids are held by proteins called **cohesins**.
- **Homologous chromosome pairs come together**.
  - Result is the **synapsis**.
  - Pairing of homologous chromosomes along their regions.
- THe homologs are held together by the **synaptonemal complex**, a net of proteins.
- Structure that results from synapsis is **bivalent**; consits of paired homologous replicated chromosomes.
- Chromatids from different homologs are referred to as **non-sister chromatids**.

#### Later Prophase I
- The nuclear envelope is complete broken down.
- Each homolog in the bivalent come to be attached to microtubule fibers that come from a spindle poole.
  - One homolog is attached to each.
  - This attachment is essential for separating homologous pairs.
- The synaptonemal complex disassembles in late prophase I, and the homologs begin to separate at many points along their length.
  - Are joined by the X-shaped structure (chiasmata, singular: chiasma)
- One chiama forms in every pair of homologous chromosomes.
  - Chiasmata mark sites of DNA breakage and rejoining.
- Chromatids that form a chiasma are **non-sister chromatids**.
  - At each chiasma, there is an *exchange of parts of chromosomes*; known as **crossing over**.

#### Metaphase I
- Kinetochore microtubules move pairs of homologous chromosomes (the bivalents) to the **metaphae plate**.
  - The place in between the poles of the spindle apparatus.
- Important points about chromosome movement:
  - In metaphase I, each bivalent is 'on' the metaphase plate (one homolog on one side and the other homolog on the other).
  - The alignment of each bivalent is independent of other bivalents.
    - Rephrased, alignment of bivalent is important.

#### Anaphase I and Telophase I
- Anaphase I begins as homologs move to different poles of the spindle apparatus.
  - Kinetochores of each homolog attach to spindle fibers; each homolog is attached to a different spindle pole.
  - Two homologous chromosomes in the bivalent separate from each other.
- Chiasmata are broken during anaphae I. (cohesin proteins are removed).
- Separating homologs are a combination of maternal and paternal segments.
- During telophase I, homologs finish moving to opposite sides of the spindle.
- **Cytokenisis** (division of the cytoplasm) occurs and two haploid daughter cells form.

#### Meiosis I: A Recap
- Chromosome movement happens through assembly and dissassembly of microtubules attached to the kinetochore.
- During meiosis I, a diploid parent cell produces two haploid daughter cells.
  - Sister chromatids remain attached to each chromosome.
  - Chromosomes in each daughter cell are a random assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes because of crossing over and independent alignment.
    
### The Phases of Meiosis II
- Chromosome replication occurred *before* meiosis I.
  - There is **no DNA replication** before meiosis II. (critical difference)
- Meiosis II *separates the sister chromatids into individual cells.*
  - Each cell contains unreplicated daughter chromosomes
- After meiosis II, there are four haploid cells.
  - Meiosis II occurs in both daughter cells produced by meiosi.
- The overall process of Meiosis produces four daughter cells from a parent cell.

#### Prophase II
- A spindle apparatus forms in both daughter cells.
- Microtubules that polymerize from the two spindle pokes attach to the kinetochores on opposite sides of every chromosome.
  - These begin to move the chromosomes towards the **middle** of the cell.

#### Metaphase II
- The chromosomes are lined up at the metaphase plate.
  - Each chromosome is attached by spindle fibers to *both* of the poles.

#### Anaphase II and Telophase II
- The sister chromatids are separated in anaphase II.
- These move to different daughter cells in telophase II.
- Each chromatid is considered to be an independent daughter chromosome.

### Mitosis versus Meiosis

## 13.2: Meiosis Promotes Genetic Variation
- Because of the crossing over and random shuffling components of meiosis I, chromosomes in one gamete are different from chromosomes in every other gamete.
- Fertilization creates genetically varied diploid offspring.
  - Does this by bringing together two haploid sets of parental chromosomes.
- Chromosome sets and varied combinations occur *only* in sexual reproduction.
  - **Asexual reproduction** produces offspring without the fusion of gametes, and is based of mitosis. Aexually produced offspring are clones (exact genetic copies).
  - **Sexual reproduction** is the production of offspring through the generation and fusion of gametes. Sexual reproduction results in offspring that have chromosome complements.

### Independent Assortment
- Each somatic cell in your body has **23 homologous pairs of chromosomes** (46 in total).
  - Half the chromosomes come from your mother, half come from your father.
- When pairs of homologous chromosomes line up during meiosis I, different combinations of maternal and paternal chromosomes result.
  - This phenomenon is known as **independent assortment**.
- The creation of new combinations of alleles is known as **genetic recombination**.
- A diploid organism can produce `2^n` combinations (*n* is the haploid chromosome number).`
  - 8.4 million combinations for humans.
  
### Crossing Over
- Segments of paternal and maternal chromatids exchange when crossing over.
- Crossing over produces new combinations of alleles *within* a chromosome.
- Genetic recombination is important because it creates genetically diverse gametes.
  - Independent asortment generates varied combinations.
  - Crossing over produces *new combinations of alleles in **each** chromosome*.

### How Does Fertilization Affect Genetic Variation?
- Crossing over and the independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes enure every gamete is unique.
- Random fertilization means that the sperm and the egg can come together, regardless of which alleles they carry.
- A human can produce ~8.4 million gamete by independent asortment.
  - Two parents can produce `8.4m * 8.4m = 70.6 * 10^12` genetically distinct offspring.

## Meiosis: Where the Sex Starts, Crash Course Biology
*Available [here](https://kcts9.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/c65df616-fffc-461b-8d70-c13bc4bc4c1a/meiosis-where-the-sex-starts-crash-course-biology-13/){:target="_blank"}*
- Sexual reproduction; cells split repeatedly to form a human.
- Most of your somatic (body) cells replicate through cell identification.
- Mitosis replicates a cell with 46 chromosomes into two identical cells.
  - However, you cannot clone yourself.
  - Mitosis is not the only cell division method we have.
- All of your body cells have the same DNA; 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs.
  - Contain versions of the same alleles; one in each pair from your mom and one from your dad.
  - Similar; pairs are 'homologous chromosome pairs'.
- Special cells that have only 1/2 of the amount: sperm and egg cells.
  - Haploid cell (half the full set of chromosomes).
  - Need each other to combine to complete the full 46 chromosomes.
- Mitosis needs meiosis.
  - Diploid cell splits in half twice, producing four cells.
- Raw material for meiosis: in ovaries or the testies.
  - Primary Oocytes or Primary Spermatocytes.
- **Interphase:** long strings of DNA begin to replicate.
  - **Centrosomes:** being to replicate as well, are a set of cylinder-like proteins that regulate how materials are moved around along ropey proteins called microtubeles.
- **Prophase 1**: centrosomes begin heading to their corners of the cell, unspooling the microtubeles.
  - Each DNA clumps with proteins into chromosomes; each chromosome is linked with its duplicate copy to form X-shaped double chromosome.
  - Each of the chromosomes when attached are chromatids.
    - Each double chromosome has two chromatids.
  - **Crossover**: Each double chromosome lines up with its homolog.
    - Double chromosomes have 4 chromatids between them.
    - One chromatid in each X gets tangled up with the other; forming crossover.
  - **Homologous Recombination**
    - During crossover, exchange DNA (recombination).
- If we simply cloned to ourselves, we would not have variation for natural election.
  - All 4 chromatids are now different; each chromatid will end up in a separate sex cells.
- One pair of chromoomes does not always go through crossover or recombination: 23rd chromosome, **sex chromosomes**.
  - Female: two complete cells.
  - Male: only one X chromosome, and the other doesn't do with the Y (not homologous)
  - Half of resulting sperm are X and half will be Y.
- **Metaphase 1**: each chromosome lines to its homologous pair partner.
- **Anaphase 1**: These get pulled apart to separate ends of the cell.
- **Telophase 1**: A nuclear membrane forms around each; cleavage forms between the cells and the two cells form. *Cytokenisis*.
  - Two haploid cells have been formed.
  - Centromeres till look like X.
  - Aim is to end up with four cells.
- Aim: not to duplicate double chromosomes, but to pull them apart into separate single-strand chromosomes.
- **Prophase II**: just bunch into separate ends.
- **Metaphase II**: chromosomes are moved into alignment into the middle of the cell.
- **Anaphase II**: the two trands are pulled apart, the crease forms, and four total cells are produced.
- Result: four cell with 23 chromosomes each.
  - Half will be male, half will be girls.
- During telophase I, more of the cytoplasm, organelles, etc. head into one of the cells; same with telophase II.
  - Forms 1 *egg* (with more nutrients and organelles to make the new embryo) and 3 polar bodies (esentially useless).

## Khan Academy Fertilization Terms
*Access [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/heredity/meiosis-and-genetic-diversity/v/fertilization-haploid-diploid-gamete-zygote-homologous){:target="_blank"}*
- When the sperm and the egg cell fuse, this is *fertilization*.
  - Produces a cell that differentiates into all the cells of our body.
- Each of the sex cells (sperm cell and the ovum) are called **gametes**.
  - Each gamete has half the number of chromosomes as the somatic cells of your body.
- Fertilization setup.
  - 23 chromosomes from your father.
    - 23rd chromosome is X or Y; if it is X, it is female; if it is Y, it i male.
  - Fuses with the ovum (egg that the mother is contributing), which has 23 additional chromosomes.
    - 23rd chromosome is X.
- When the two gametes are fused:
  - The 'fertilized egg' iss the **zygote**.
  - 23 chromosomes from the father and 23 chromosomes from the mother form 23 chromosome pairs.
    - Pairs are *homologous chromosomes*.
    - Means that these two chromosomes code for the same proteins, but there are variants for how they code for those variants.
- Haploid and diploid number/cells.
  - Human haploid number is 23 ('hapl' - single), number of chromosomes in each of the gametes.
    - Referred to as *n*.
  - Human diploid number is 46 ('di' - two), number of cells in zygote.
    - Referred to as 2*n*.

## Chromosomal Crossover in Meiosis I
*Access [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/heredity/meiosis-and-genetic-diversity/v/chromosomal-crossover-in-meiosis-i){:target="_blank"}*.
- Germ cell; a cell that can go through mitosis to produce germ cells or undergo meiosis to produce other germ cells, or to undergo meiosis to produce gametes.
- Hypothetical: Diploid Number is 4.
- **Interphase**: grows and replicates DNA; after replicating, it is still one *chromosome*.  
  - Made up of two sister *chromatids*.
- At this point, either mitosis or  meiosis can happen.
  - This will focus on meiosis.
- **Prophase I**
  - Nuclear membrane begins to dissolve.
  - DNA begin to bunch up into 'condensed form' into 'X's.
  - Centromere is at the middle of the Xs.
  - DNA has been replicated; in each of the chromosomes exist two siter chromatids.
  - In a homologous pair, there are *four chromatids*. Often called a tetrad.
  - *Genetic/homologous* recombination; may contain different DNA but code for the same genes.
- Recombination; DNA is swapped at certain sections.
  - Happens fairly often, and is a way to get variation.
  - Exchange of information between these chromosomes.
  - Generally happens at fairly 'clean' points, called the chiasma.
    - plural: chiasmata.

## Genetic Variation
*By Utah Learn Genetics, access [here](https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/evolution/variation){:target="_blank"}*
- Genetic variation happens through mutation and recombination
- A gene variation that makes it unable to see could be harmful, for example.
- A gene variation that makes it more attractive to pollinators allows its genes to be pased down.
- Most gene variation are not good or bad (neutral).
  - Don't effect survival, so usually stay in a population.
- Harmful variations get weeded out.
- Variation is necessary to life.

## Allele Shuffling
*By Utah Learn Genetics, access[here](https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/evolution/allele){:target="_blank"}*
- Alleles have variations in their DNA sequences.
  - May change amino acid, or when, where, and how much protein is made.
- A population can have many alleles for each gene.
- The traits are influenced by combinations of alleles.
- Pairs of chromosomes have pairs of genes arranged in the same order.
- Chromosomes are copied, recombined, shuffled, and split into four haploid cells (sperm/eggs).

## What is inheritance?
*By Utah Learn Genetics, access[here](https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/evolution/inheritance/){:target="_blank"}*
- When things reproduce, they pass DNA to their offspring.
- Some living things like bacteria can reproduce without a partner.
- People reproduce with a partner (sexual reproduction)
  - We all have two copies of each gene.
  - This influences our inherited traits.
- Children resemble their genes, but unique gene combinations give children a unique set of characteristic.
