## Video - Cellular Respiration Introduction
*By Khan Academy, access [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cellular-energetics/cellular-respiration-ap/v/introduction-to-cellular-respiration){:target="_blank"}*

- Cellular respiration is a very important chemical reaction.
  - This is how we derive energy from *glucose* (most food ends up as glucose).
- Chemical reaction:
  - Glucose: `C6 H12 O6`.
  - Add 6 molecular oxygen: `6O2`.
  - Produces `6CO2` + `6H2O` + `energy`.
  - Complete: `C6 H12 O6` + `6O2` ➡️ `6CO2` + `6H2O` + `energy`
- ATP is the energy currency.
  - Energy is used to produce ATP.
  - Some of the energy released is heat; also produces 38 ATPs that can be used by cells.
    - Large variation; can also have 28-29 ATPs.

### Glycolysis
- Means "breaking up glycose" (glycol = glycose, ysis = break up)
  - glucose = gluc (sweet) + ose (sugar)
    - e.g. sucrose, lactose, etc.
- Breaks up the glucose from a 6-carbon molecule (e.g. `C-C-C-C-C-C`) into two (`C-C_C` and `C-C-C`)
  - Glucose is a ring, portrayed here as the backbone. Also has hydrogens and oxygens not included.
- Glycolysis *needs* **2 ATPs** and *generates* **4 ATPs**.
  - Net-wise generates 2 ATPs.
  - `!` Can occur in the absence (or presence) of oxygen. (anaerobic process)

### Krebs Cycle
- The Krebs Cycle generates an additional 2 ATP.
- `!` Requires oxygen; is aerobic.

### Electron Transport Chain
- Produces the bulk of the ATPs (34 of them).
- Is an aerobic process (required oxygen).
- Glycolysis and Krebs cycle are taking `NAD+` and adding hydrogens to from `NADH`.
  - For one molecule of glucose, converts `NAD+`s into 10 `NADH`s, which drive the electron transport chain. 
  - Durns `FAD` into `FADH2`.
- Cellular respiration is repackaging the energy in glucose to 38 ATPs and produces heat.
  - Done through three stages: glucose (generating `NADH`s), Krebs Cycle, Electron Transport Chain.
  
### Lactic Acid and Fermentation
- You can produce 2 ATPs without oxygen; nowhere near enough that can be produced when you have oxygen.
- When you run out of oxygen, byproducts of glycolysis go into a side product called fermentation (because cannot proceed to Krebs cycle).
  - Muscles produce lactic acid fermentation; yeast will do alcohol fermentation.
  
## Cellular Respiration Lab Background
*Pages 3-5 of cellular respiration lab manual.*
- Plants and algae are the only organisms that can use sun energy through *photosynthesis*.
  - Sugars produced are transported and stored in roots and seeds.
- How do plants acquire necessary energy?
  - Answer: metabolize stored sugars through **cellular respiration.**

### ATP and Energy
- All cells need energy.
- Energy is contained in the *chemical bonds of organic compounds*.
  - e.g. carbohydrates, proteins, fats.
- When sugar molecule chemical bonds are broken down, energy is used to synthesize a molecule called *adenosine triphosphate* (ATP).
- ATP is the main form of energy used.
  - Energy stored in the three-phosphate tail.
  - When one of the bonds is broken, ATP becomes ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and releases a large amount of energy.
- ATP and ADP are constantly cycled in cells.
  - Energy used for respiration, fermentation, & other metabolic processes.
  - Energy is required to turn ADP ➡️ ATP (adding a phosphate group).
  - Energy is released when ATP ➡️ ADP (removing a phosphate group).

### Aerobic Cellular Respiration
- Four processes: glycolysis, acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthesis, Krebs cycle, and electron-transport chain.
- Complete metabolism of one sugar molecule during cellular respiration:
```
C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 ➡️ 6CO2 + 6H2O + 36 ATP
```

### Glycolysis
- A series of 10 reactions that converts a 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon molecules called **pyruvate**.
- Occurs in the cell cytoplasm.
- Four ATP molecules and two NADH molecules are produced.
  - Two ATP are required to start the reactions.
- If there is oxygen, cells will undergo aerobic cellular respiration.

### Acetyl-Coenzyme A Synthesis
- In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate enters the mitochondria.
- Is converted into a molecule called acetyl-CoA.
  - One molecule of CO2 and one molecule of NADH are produced during this conversion.
  
### Krebs Cycle
- Also known as the citric acid cycle.
- Each molecule of acetyl-CoA is metabolized to produce 2 molecules of CO2.
  - Some released energy is used to produce ATP.
  - Some energy is released via electrons.
    - Transferred to carrier molecules `NAD+` and `FAD` to yield *reduced forms* `NADH` and `FADH2`.

### Electron Transport Chain
- Electrons in these electron carriers can be used to synthesize ATP in the electron-transport chain.
- `NADH` and `FADH2` molecules are *electron carriers* because they transport electrons and hydrogen atoms to several proteins.
  - These are called the electron-transport chain.
- Hydrogens and electrons are removed; `NADH` is oxidized to become `NAD+` and `FADH2` is oxidized to become `FADH`.
  - These electron carrier molecules cycle between oxidized and reduced forms.
- When electrons are removed from `NADH` and `FADH2`, are transported from one protein to the next.
  - Release energy used to move hydrogen ions around the mitochondria.
  - Ions accumulate and form an *ionic gradient*.
- Ionic gradient creates an *electrochemical imbalance* used to produce ATP.
  - Hydrogen ions pass through a membrane channel formed by **ATP synthetase**.

#### ATP Synthetase
- Acts like a windmill.
- Flow of hydrogen ions throuhg the channel causes one part of the ATP synthetase to spin.
  - This drives production of ATP.
- Catalyzes the phosphorylation of ADP to add another phosphate, producing ATP.
  - Eukaryotic cells: electron donated from each `NADH` yields 3 ATP molecules, one electron donated from each `FADH2` yields 2 ATP molecules.
  - Electron-transport chain produces 16 ATP molecules for each pyruvate.
  - Glucose molecule produces two pyruvate molecules; therefore aerobic respiration produces about 36 ATP.

#### Oxygen
- Oxygen enters equations at last step of the electron-transport chain.
- Electrons are transferred to oxygen when they reach the last protein.
  - Results in the formation of water (`H2O`).
- Oxygen is the *terminal electron carrier*.
  - Transfer of electrons to oxygen enables more electrons to enter the start of the chain.
- If no oxygen is available, no more electrons can be transferred.
  - In the absence of oxygen, the electron-transport chain and Krebs cycle cannot function.
  - Cell is starved of ATP for energy.

### Using a Respirometer
- This lab uses a respirometer to measure the *respiration rate* of germinating and dormant pea seeds.
  - Beads are used as a controls ample.
- Respirometer is composed of:
  - Vial containing peas
  - Volume of air
  - Mouth of vial sealed with 1-hole rubber stopper.
- Experiment:
  1. Enter respirometer is submerged underwater.
  2. If the peas respire, they will use `O2` and release `CO2`.
  3. There will be no change in volume of gas (1 mole of oxygen for 1 mole of carbon dioxide).
  4. Experiment with changing this equilibrium by placing a potassium hydroxide (KOH)-saturated cotton ball at the bottom of the vial.
  5. KOH reacts w/ `CO2` to form potassium carbonate (`K2CO3`) (a solid).
    - Reaction: `CO2 + 2KOH ➡️ K2CO3 + H2O`
    - Inside the respirometer, `K2CO3` dissolves and the volume of gas is *reduced*.
  6 As the volume of gas decreases, water moves from the bath into a submerged pipet.
  7. Gas volume decrease is measured, which will be used to calculate the rate of respiration.
- Avogadro's Law.
  > At constant temperature and pressure, 1 mole of gas has the same volume as 1 mole of any other gas.
  

### Summary in Tabular Form

| Process | Starting Material | Net Energy Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Glycolysis | 1 Glucose | 2 `NADH`, 2 ATP |
| Acetyl-CoA Synthesis and the Krebs Cycle | 2 Pyruvate | 8 `NADH`, 2 `FADH2`, 2 ATP |
| Electron-Transport Chain | 10 `NADH`, 2 `FADH2` | 32 ATP |

## Determing the Rate of Cellular Respiration
- Looking at the equation for cellular respiration:
```
C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 ➡️ 6CO2 + 6H2O + 36 ATP
```
- Rate of respiration can be measured by production of `CO2`, consumption of `O2`, or release of energy (int he from of heat).
- We will measure oxygen production in the lab.
- Consider the **ideal gas law:**
  - `pV = nRT`.
  - `p` = pressure of gas
  - `V` = volume of gas
  - `n` = number of molecules of the gas
  - `R` = the gas constant
  - `T` = temperature of the gas
- Can be rewritten as `V = nRT / P`.
  - Changes in volume are due to temperature and pressure fluctuations.
  - Water baths minimize this change.
  - Volume changes in control group (w/ beads, not peas) will be used to correct volume changes.
- `KOH` will be used to convert `CO2` into a solid such that the gas quantity depletes over time.
