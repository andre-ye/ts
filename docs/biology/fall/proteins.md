## Amino Acids and Their Polymerization
- Modern cells produce tens of thousands of distinct proteins.
- Most molecules are composed of **just 20 different building bocks**: amino acids.
  - Share a common structure.

### The Structure of Amino Acids
- Carbon atoms have a valence of four.
  - They can form up to 4 covalent bonds.
- In all 20 amino acids, **a central carbon atom bonds covalently to 4 different groups of atoms:**
  - `H` - hydrogen atom.
  - `NH2` - amino functional group.
  - `COOH` - carboxyl functional group.
  - `R-group ('side chain')`.
- Combination of amino and carboxyl groups is key to how these molecules behave.
  - In water (`pH=7`), amino acids ionize.
    - Concentration of protons at this pH causes amino group to act as a base.
    - Attracts proton.
  - Carboxyl group acts **as an acid.**
    - Highly electronegative oxygen atoms pull electron away from hydrogen atom.
    - It is easy for this group to lose a proton.
  - The charges on these functional groups:
    - Keep amino acids in solution, where they can interact with each other.
    - Affect amino acid's chemical reactivity.

### The Nature of Side Chains
- `R-group` or `side chain` represents part of amino acid core structure that makes each of the 20 amino acids unique.
  - `R-grops` vary from single hydrogen atom to large structures.
- Properties of amino acids vary because `R-groups` vary.

#### Functional Groups Affect Reactivity
- Several of side chains in amino acids contain `carboxyl`, `sulfhydryl`, `hydroxyl`, or amino functional groups.
  - Functional groups can participate in chemical reactions.
- **Example:** amino acids with sulfhydryl group (`-SH`) in their side chains can form disulfide (`S-S`) bonds that help link different parts of large proteins.
  - Bonds form between proteins in hair.
- Some amino acids contain side chains with no functional groups.
  - Consist of only `C` and `H` atoms.
  - Rarely participate in chemical reactions.
- **Influence of amino acids on protein function determined primarily by size and shape rather than reactivity.**

#### Polarity and Charge of R-Groups Affect Solubility
- Nature of `R-group` affects solubility of an amino acid.
  - Polar and electrically charged `R-groups` interact with water and are **hydrophilic**.
  - Nonpolar `R-groups` lack charged or highly electronegative atoms to form hydrogen bonds withw ater. These are **hydrophobic.**

#### Categorizing Amino Acid R-Groups
- Amino acid `R-groups` are divided into three types:
- **charged**, acidic and basic;
- **uncharged polar**;
- **nonpolar**.
- Ask these four questions:
  1. Does the `R-group` have a negative charge? If so, it is **acidic** and has lost a proton.
  2. Does the `R-group` have a positive charge? If so, it is **basic** and has gained a proton.
  3. If the `R-group` is uncharged, does it have an oxygen atom? If so, the electronegative oxygen will form polar covalent bond in the `R-group`, making it **uncharged polar**.
  4. If the `R-group` does not have a charge or an oxygen atom, it is **nonpolar**.

### How Amino Acids Link to Form Proteins
- Amino acids polymerize when a bond forms between **carboxyl group** of one amino acid and **amino group** of another.
- `C-N` covalent bond that results from condensation reaction is **peptide bond**.
  - Water molecule is removed from condensation reaction, *carboxyl group converted to **carbonyl** functional group (`C=O`) and amino group becomes `N-H`*.

#### The Peptide Bond
- Peptide bonds are very stable.
- Nitrogen can intermitantly donate its pair of unshared valence electrons to carbon in `C-N`, forming `C=N`.
  - Pair of electrons pushed from the carbonyl `(C=0)` to the oyxgen atom, forming a single bond with oxygen anion.
- **Amino acids linked by peptide bonds in a chain are referred to as residues.**
  - Distinguishes from *free amino acid monomers.*
- **Three points to note about the peptide-bonded backbone:**
  - *Regroup orientation.* Side chains of each residue extend from the backbone. Makes it easier to interact with each other and water.
  - *Directionality.* An amino group on one end (`N-terminus`) and a carboxyl group on the other (`C-terminus`).
  - *Flexibility.* Single bonds on either side of the peptide bond can rotate. Structure as a whole is flexible.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| oligopeptide/peptide | Means 'few-peptides'. Name for polymers with 50 or less amino acids. |
| polypeptide | Means 'many-peptides'. Name for polymers with 50 or more amino acids. |
| protein | Any chain of amino acid residues. Formal use: 'protein' as the complete functional form of a molecule. |

#### Polymerization of Proteins in Early Earth
- Process of linking together amino acids required other cellular factors.
- If rpoteins were responsible for start of life in chemical evolution, must have occurred **without cellular factors**.
- **Can amino acids spontaneously assemble into proteins?**
- Several mechanisms could have led to self-polymerization:
  - Researchers have been *able to generate stable polymers* by mixing free amino acids with a source of chemical energy & mineral particles. Growing macromolecules are protected from hydrolysis if they cling to a mineral surface.
  - Conditions that simulate hot, metal-rich environments of undersea volcanoes, researchers observe amino acids formed and polymerized.
  - Amino acids joined into polymers in cooler water if energy rich carbon and sulfar-containing gas is present.

## What Do Proteins Look Like?
- Structure gives rise to function.
  - Protein size and shape variability means there is a wide diversity in function.

### Primary Structure
- Each protein has a unique sequence of amino acids.
- Unique sequence of amino acids in protein is **primary structure.**
- 20 types of amino acids and tens of thousands of amino acid residues, number of primary structures that are possible almost limitless.
- `R-groups` represent size, shape, chemical reactivity, and solubility.

### Secondary Structure
- Generated by interactions between functional groups and peptide-bonded backbone.
- Distinctively shaped sections of lienar sequence stabilized by hydrogen bonding that occurs between oxygen and carbonyl group of one amino acid and hydrogen on amino group of another. 
- **Hydrogen bonding between sections of the backbone is possible only when polypeptide bends in a way that brings `C=O` and `N-H` groups close together.**
  - Polar groups are aligned when backbone forms:
  - **alpha-helix**; polypeptide's backbone is coiled.
  - **beta-pleated sheet**; segments of the peptide chain bend 180 degrees and fold in the same plane.
- Formation due to *specific geometry of side chains.*
- Each hydrogen bond is weak compared to a covalent bond, **but in large numbers it can make polypeptides very stable.**

### Tertiary Structure
- Distinctive overall three-dimensional shape is its tertiary structure.
- Results from *interactions between residues brought together as the backbone bends and folds in space.*
- Residues interact with one another and fold in space.

#### Five Important R-Group Interactions
1. **Hydrogen Bonding**. Hydrogen bonds form polar side chains and opposite partial charges either on the peptide backbone or other `R-groups`.
2. **Hydrophobic Interactions.** In an aqueous solution, water molecules interact with the hydrophillic polar side chains, forcing hydrophobic polar side chains to group in the middle.
3. **van der Waals Interactions.** Once nonpolar side chains are close to each other via hydrophobic interactions, they are stabilized by van der Waals interactions.
4. **Covalent Bonding.** Covalent bonds cna form between sde chains of two cysteines through reactions of sulfhydryl groups. `Disulfide` bonds referred to as *bridges* because they create strong links between regions of the same polypeptide.
5. **Ionic Bonding.** Ionic bonds form between groups that have full and opposing charges, like ionized acidic and basic side chains.

### Quaternary Structure
- Some proteins contain multiple polypeptides that interact to form a single functional structure.
- Combination of polypeptides gives some proteins quaternary structure.
- Cells contain **macromolecular machines** - complexes of multiple proteins that assemble to carry out a particular function.
  - Ribosome contains several nucleic acid molecules as well as >50 proteins.

### Important Messages About Structures
- Combination of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quarternary levels is responsible for diversity of sizes and shpaes.
- Protein folding is directed by the sequence of amino acids present in primary structure.
- Most elements of protein structure are the result of folding polypeptide chains.

### Summary of Levels of Structures in Tabular Form

| Level | Description | Stabilized by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | Sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide | Peptide bonds |
| Secondary | Formation of alpha-helices and beta-pleated sheets in a polypeptide (dependent on primary structure) | Hydrogen bonding between groups along the peptide-bonded backbone |
| Tertiary | Overall 3-dimensional shape of polypeptide, based on contribution from secondary structures | Bonds and other interactions between R-groups or between R-groups and a peptide-bonded backbone. |
| Quaternary | Shape produced by combinations of polypeptides (combinations of tertiary structures) | Bonds and toher interactions between R-groups and between different polypeptides. |

**Key idea: levels of structure are __hierarchical.__**

## Folding and Function
- Folding is spontaneous in many cases because chemical bonds and interactions that occur release enough energy to overcome a decrease in entropy.
  - Folded molecule has less potential energy and is more stable than the unfolded molecule.

### Normal Folding is Crucial to Function
- Ribonuclease can be unfolded or **denatured** by treating it with compounds that break hydrogen and disulfied bonds.
  - Denatured ribonuclease unable to function normally.
  - Could no longer degrade nucleic acids.
- When chemical denaturing agents removed, nuclease folded spontaneously and functioned normally.
  - Primary sequence contained all information necessary for folding, and that it was essential for function.
- Cells contain proteins called **molecular chaperones.**
  - These facilitate protein folding.
  - Molecular chaperones belong to a family of molecules called heat-shock proteins.
    - Produced in large quantities after cells experience denaturing effects of high tempratures.
- Nonpolar side chains of unfolded polypeptides can clmp together and disrumpt normal folding process.
  - Molecular chaperones attach to hydrophobic patches before aggregates can form.

### Protein Shape is Flexible
- Although each protein has a characteristic folded shape necessary for function, **must proteins are flexible and dynamic** when they are not actively performing that function.
- Over half of proteins have disordered regions lacking apparent structure.
  - Each protein will exist in several shapes until they need to adopt a single folded and functional form.

#### Protein Folding is Often Regulated
- Function of a protein is dependent on its shape.
- Controlling when or where it is folded regulates its activity.
- Interactions induce proteins to fold into an ordered, active conformation.
- Regulated folding plays a major role in controlling and coordinating cellular activities.

#### Folding Can Be Infectious
- Certain normal proteins can be induced to fold into infectious, disease-causing agents.
- Proteins: **prions**, or prteinaceous infectious particles.
- Infectious prions: alternately folded forms of normal proteins present in healthy individuals.
  - Versions of a protein have the same primary structure but have different shapes.

## Protein Functions Are as Diverse as Protein Structures
- Proteins perform more types of cell functions than *any other molecule.*
- Proteins are crucial to most tasks for cells and organisms:
  - **Catalysis.** Many proteins are specialized to catalyze, or speed up, chemical reactions. A protein that functions as a catalyst is an *enzyme.*
  - **Structure.** Structural proteins make up body components.
  - **Movement.** Motor proteins and contractile proteins are responsible for moving the cell itself.
  - **Signaling.** Proteins involved in carrying and recieving signals from cell to cell inside the body.
  - **Transport.** Proteins allow particular molecules to enter and exit cells or carry them throughout the body.
  - **Defense.** Proteins called antibodies attack and destroy viruses and bacteria.
- **Catalysis may be the most important function.** Speed. Life consists of chemical reactions.
  - Doesn't occur fast enough unless a catalyst is present.

### Why Are Enzymes Good Catalysts?
- Catalyzed reactions involve one or more reactants: **substrates.**
- Enzymes are effective catalysts because they hold substrates in a precise orientation to react.

#### Lock and Key Model
- Hypothesis by Emil Fischer in 1894.
- Enzymes are analogous to the lock; keys are substrates that fit into the lock and react.
- Location where substrates bind and react is the enzyme's **active site.**
- No other class of macromolecules can match proteins for catalytic potential. 

### Did Life Arise from a Self-Replicating Enzyme?
- Could be argued that a protein catalyst was the first molecule capable of replication.
- Amino acids were likely abundant during chemical evolution.
  - Could have polymerized to form small proteins.
- **Most researchers are skeptical that life could have begun with a protein.**
  - Proteins would need to possess information, replicate, and evolve to achieve attributes of life.
  - Information carried in proteins is necessary for function but cannot be used as a template or mold for replication.


## Protein Structure
- Most proteins are folded into a complex, globular shape.
- Each protein consists of one or more chains of amino acid minomers.
  - Linked by peptide bonds.
  - Protein polymer often known as `polypeptides`.
- Proteins are very complex, so described in **4 layers of structure**.

### Primary Structure
  - Each protein has a unique primary structure.
    - Number and sequence of amino acids, making up the polypeptide chain.
    - 20 amino acids are used to build proteins.
    - Various amino acids could be linked in almost any sequence.
  - Structure of a single amino acid:
    - Same backbone: amino group, `C`, `H`, carboxyl group
    - `R` group that projects out from the backbone unique.
      - This makes each of the 20 amino acids unique.
      - Affects folding of the protein.
      
### Secondary Structure
  - Parts of the polypeptide chain are folded or coiled.
  - Examples:
    - Alpha helix - chain twists forms a helix.
    - Beta pleated - chain folds back on itself, or two regions lie parallel.
  - Results from hydrogen bonding between atoms of the polypeptide backbone.
    - `O` and `N` along the backbone are highly electronegativity.
    - Bound to `H`; are attracted to each other at regular intervals.
    - Part of the protein twists on itself.
    
### Tertiary Structure
  - Superimposed on primary and secondary structure: irregular loops and folds that give the protein its 3d shape.
  - Results from interactions along R groups.
    - Basic & Acidic groups ionize.
      - Can form ionic bonds.
    - Hydrophilic or polar `R`-groups may hydrogen bond with each other or turn outwards and bond with surrounding water.
    - Hydrophobic or nonpolar `R` groups cluster on the inside of the protein, away from water.
    - Furhter stabalized by sulfur-containing strong covalent bonds.
    
### Quaternary Structure
  - Some proteins are made up multiple polypeptide chains.
  - Results from combination of two or more polypeptide subunites.
  - Stabilized by same interactions that stabalize tertiary structure.
  - For example: hemoglobin (oxygen carrying protein of blood)
    - 2 Alpha chains
    - 2 Beta chains

## Protein Functions and Types
- Proteins are the most complicated molecules known.
- A cell contains thousands of types of proteins.
  - These carry out different functions.
- Each protein's function is determined by its 3-dimensional structure.
  - Function depends on shape and changes in shape.

  - Major Ampullate Spidroin Protein makes the black widow spider web.
  - Collagen strengthens bones, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and skin.

### Signal Proteins
- Hormonal proteins that coordinate an organism's activity by acting as a signal between cells.
- **Insulin** signals an animal's cells to take in sugar.
- Hormone receptor is also a protein.
- Signal molecules bond with receptor proteins to deliver messages.
- Some signal molecules are also proteins.
- Examples
  - Adrenergic receptor activated by non-protein hormone (adrenaline) in times of stress. Signals heart cells to beat faster and liver cells to release glucose.
  - Insulin released into blood stream after meal. Activates insular receptor, which signals muscle and fat cells to store blood sugar.

### Transport Proteins
- Carry molecules from place to place.
- Allows certain solute molecules to enter the cell.
- Examples:
- Cytochrome C proteins form one protein complex to another, generating energy to power the cell.
  - Hemoglobin is the transport protein that carries oxygen in the blood.


### Sensory Proteins

  - Cryptochrome proteins in monarch butterflies sense Earth's magnetic field.

### Enzyme Proteins
- A protein that changes the rate of a chemical reaction without itself being changed into a different molecule in the process.
- Control and regulate all chemical reactions.
- **Build and break down molecules.**
- Critical for growth, digestion, and other processes.
  - Without enzymes, chemical reactions would happen to slowly to sustain life.
- Examples:
  - Lactase helps infants digest lactose.
  - Luciferase makes fireflies grow and controls a chemical reaction that gives off light.
  - DNA polymerase builds DNA molecules. Reads old DNA strand and inserts correct nucleotides into the new strand.

### Storage Proteins

  - Glucose is a storage protein in seeds of wheat, barley, and rye.

### Contractile (Motor) Proteins
- Move parts of a cell.
- Proteins working together in muscle groups can move an entire animal.
- Examples:
  - To contract muscle cells, millions of myosin motors slide along chains of actin proteins.

### Gene Regulatory Proteins
- Bind to DNA in particular locations and control whether certain genes will be read.
- Allows cells to be specialized to certain functions.
- Examples:
  - p53 protein prevents cell from dividing when DNA is damaged.
  - Androgen and estrogen receptors control genes that trigger puberty.

### Defensive Proteins
- Defensive proteins help organisms fight infection, heal damaged tissue, and evade predators.
- Examples:
  - Antibodies bind to invaders like viruses and mark foreign objects for destruction.
