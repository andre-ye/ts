## Textbook Notes - Chapter 2.1 to 2.2
 *Directions: study chapter 2.1 and 2.2 (up to page 66; stop before the section "Cohesion, Adhesion, and Surface Tension").*
 
### 2.1: Atoms, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks of Chemical Evolution

#### Introduction
- Four types of atoms - hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (H, C, N, O) make up about 96% of all matter.
- Fundamental questions to understanding how simple substances evolved into complex molecules found in living cells:
    1. What is the physical structure of H, C, N, O atoms?
    2. What are the structures of simple molecules (water, CO2, etc.) that serve as building blocks of chemical evolution?
- Key theme in biology: **structure affects function**.


#### Atoms, Protons, and Neutrons
- An `atom` is the smallest identifiable unit of matter.
    - Contains a characteristic number of protons, called its `atomic number`. This is written at bottom left of the symbol.
    - Sum of protons and neutrons in atom is called `mass number` and is written at top left of symbol.
- Simple way of depicting an atom: _extremely small particles called electrons orbit an `atomic nucleus` made up of larger particles called protons and neutrons_.
    - Every element except hydrogen has one or more neutrons in its nucleus.
    - `Protons` have a positive electric charge (-1), `neutrons` are electrically neutral, and `electrons` have a negative electric charge (-1).
    - Number of protons and electrons in an atom are the same: _atom is electrically neutral_.

#### Elements and Daltons
- `Element` - a substance that consists entirely of a single type of atom.
- `Dalton (Da)` is used to measure the masses of electrons, etc. Masses of protons and neutrons are about 1 Da. An electron's mass is so small it is *usually ignored*.
- The number of protons in an element does not change; if the atomic number in an atom changes, it is no longer the same element.
 
#### Isotopes
- The number of neutrons *can vary*. **Forms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are `isotopes`**. 
    - Isotopes of the same element can have different masses because they have different numbers of neutrons. 
    - `Atomic weight` of an element is the average of all masses of naturally occuring isotopes in nature. This is why atomic weight can be slightly different from mass number.
    - Some isotopes are not stable; these are `radioactive isotopes`. The nucleus will decay and release energy in the form of radiation.


#### Structure of Atoms
- The arrangement of electrons around the nucleus helps us understand how different elements behave.
- Electrons move around the atomic nucleus in regions called `orbitals`. An orbital can hold up to two electrons (a pair).
- Orbitals are grouped into levels called `electron shells`. These are numbered 1, 2, 3, ... to indicate how close to how far the levels are from the nucleus.
- An electron shell contains a specific number of orbitals. Each orbital in a shell is loaded with at least one electron before any orbital can be filled with a second paired electron. Electrons in an atom must also be filled from innermost to outermost.
- The outermost shell of the element is called the `valence shell`. Electrons in this shell are `valence electrons`. 
    - The number of unpaired electrons in the atom's valence shell is its `valence`.

#### Bonds
- A `covalent bond` is when two atoms share electrons, and the connected atoms form a `molecule`.
    - Covalent bonds can make atoms more stable (e.g. when the valence shell is not filled with only one electron, but together the valence shell is filled). **Shared electrons 'glue' atoms together into molecules**.
    - The two bonded atoms are written as H-H or H2.


- Electrons participating in a covalent bond are not always shared equally in the atoms involved. This can heppn in `compounds`, where atoms of different elements are bonded together.
- When atoms of different elements bond, they may pull electrons towards their nuclei with different strengths; this is called `electronegativity`.
    - Electronegativity is caused by the number of protons in the nucleus and the distance between the nucleus and the valence shell.
    - E.g. like a magnet; **electronegativity is caused by the strength of the 'magnet' *and* how far away the object is from it.**
    - Electronegativities of six most abundant elements in organisms: O > N > S = C = H = P (= being approximate).
- A bond that involves equally shared electrons is a `nonpolar covalent bond`.
- A bond that involves assymetrically shared electrons is a `polar covalent bond`. In a polar covalent bond, electrons spend most of their time closer to the nucleus of the most electronegative atom.


- **Example: the water molecule**. Written as H2O (two hydrogen and one oxygen atom).
- Electrons involved in covalent bonds in water are not shared equally but are held much more tightly by the oxygen nucleus than by the hydrogen nuclei.
- Because electrons are shared unequally in each O-H bond, they spend more time near the oxygen atom, giving it a partial negative charge (recall electrons have a negative charge); they spend less time near the hydrogen atoms, giving them a partial positive charge.
- Lowercase delta is used for this. O has δ- and H has δ+

#### Ionic Bonding & Ions
- `Ionic bonds` are similar to covalent bonds, but electrons in ionic bonds are completely transferred from one atom to another.
    - This electron transfer gives each of the two resulting atoms a full valence shell.
- Atoms or molecules that carry full charges instead of partial charges that come from polar covalent bonds are called `ions`. The sodium ion is written as Na⁺.
    - Positively charged ions are called `cations` (KAT-eye-un).
    - Negatively charged ions are called `anions` (AN-eye-un).
- Examples:
    - E.g. sodium atom (Na) has three electron shells with one lone electron in its valence shell. They can lose that electron to leave them with a second full shell, which is more energetically stable. Because it has one more proton than it has electrons, the atom has a net electric charge of +1.
    - E.g. chlorine atoms (Cl) tend to gain an electron, filling their outermost shell. The resulting ion has a net charge of -1, because it has one more electron than proton.
    - E.g. sodium cations and chloride anions form sodium chloride (NaCL, table salt); held together by strong opposite charges in their ions.
- Covalent bonds share electrons to make both more stable. Ionic bonds are between atoms that have full charges (-1 or +1) and attract strongly.
- **The electron-sharing continuum.** _Equal sharing of electrons to complete transfer of electrons._
    - Nonpolar covalent bonds. _Atoms have no charge, atoms are shared equally._
    - Polar covalent bonds _Atoms have a partial charge because of electronegativity; electrons spend more time around certain atoms in the bond._
    - Ionic bonds. _Atoms have full charges that are directly opposite each other to form strong bonds._
- Note - most compounds present in living organisms are formed with either nonpolar or polar covalent bonds.


#### Simple Molecules formed with C, H, N, O
- `CH4 (Methane)` is formed when four hydrogen atoms are convalently bonded with each of the four unpaired electrons of a carbon atom.
- `NH3 (Ammonia)` is formed when three hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded with three unpaired electrons in nitrogen.
- `H2O (Water)` is formed when two hydrogen atoms bond with two unpaired electrons in oxygen.


- Atoms with more than one unpaired electron in the valence shell can also form double bonds or triple bonds.
- `CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)` is formed when a pair of unmatched electrons in two oxygen atoms are bonded with two pairs of unmatched electrons in a carbon atom.
- `N2 (Molecular Nitrogen)` is formed when the three unmatched electrons in each of two nitrogen atoms bond.


- There are different 3-dimensional geometries to these simple molecules.
    - N2 and CO2 have simple linear structures. There are only two atoms in N2, so the model can only be linear. In CO2, the two C=O bonds repel each other 180 degrees apart.
    - CH4 has a tetrahedral structure, which allows the four C-H bonds to get as far away from each other as possible.
    - Water's bond geometry is bent rather than linear. Has four orbitals in valence shell that repel each other, but two orbitals are filled with unshared electron pairs, which pushes the O-H bonds closer together.


#### Representing Molecules
- Molecular formulas are compact, but don't have much information. Just indicate numbers and types of atoms in molecules. _e.g. CO2, H2O, etc._
- Structural formulas indicate which atoms are bonded together. Single, double, and triple bonds are represented by single, double, and triple dashes. _e.g. O=C=O._
- Ball-and-stick models take up more space than structural formulas both provide information on three-dimensional shapes and indicate sizes of atoms.
- Space-filling models are difficult to read but accurately depict the relative sizes of atoms and their spatial relationships.

### 2.2: Properties of Water and the Early Oceans
- Life is based on water; it arose in an aqueous environment.
    - 75 percent of volume in a typical cell is water.
- Water is an excellent `solvent` - an agent for dissolving, or getting substances into `solution`.
    - e.g. dumping sugar into coffee; the sugar dissappears as the sugar molecules disperse in the aqueous solution. Sugar molecules are separated and interact with water's partial charges.
- Substances are likely to come into contact with one another when they are `solutes` (dissolved into a solvent like water).

#### Properties Correlated with Water's Structure
- Water has small size, highly polar covalent bonds, and a bent shape resulting in unique polarity among molecules.
- ==Water is an efficient solvent.==
- Recall that...
    - ...the covalent O-H bond is polar (difference in electronegativites of hydrogen and oxygen). Oxygen atom has partial negative charge and hydrogen atom has partial positive charge.
    - ...water molecules are bent. This shape makes the partial negative charge on the oxygen atom stick out away from partial positive charges on the hydrogen atoms, gives the water molecule a `polar nature`.
    - When molecules are polar, they carry a partial positive charge on one side and a partial negative charge on the other.
- When two water molecules approach each other, the partial positive charge on hydrogen attracts the partial negative charge on oxygen. This is an example of a `hydrogen bond`.
    - Hydrogen bonds also form between water molecules and polar solutes, like sugar glucose, or between water and ions, like Na⁺ and Cl⁻from table salt.
    - Substances that interact with water this way are `hydrophilic` (water-loving). Almost any ionic compound and polar molecule can dissolve in water.


- Nonpolar molecules do not readily dissolve into aqueous solutions. Substances that do not interact with water are `hydrophobic` (water-fearing).
    - Interactions of hydrophobic molecules with water are minimal or nonexistent; surrounding water molecules form hydrogen bonds *with each other*.
    - These are `hydrophobic interactions`.
- When hydrophobic molecules are close to each other, they are further stabilized by weak electrical attractions, known as `van der Waals interactions`.
- Example: octane (C8H18), a component of gasoline, is a nonpolar molecule; when put in water it is forced to interact with itself, because water is more stable when it interacts with itself rather than with nonpolar molecules.
    - Analogy: Unstable conditions are -1 and 1, stable condition is 0. Combining an unstable -1 with a stable 0 yields -1, still an unstable condition; combining an unstable -1 with an unstable +1 yields a stable 0.

## Video Notes - Chemical Basis for LIfe

### Structure of the Atomic Nucleus
- Five important atoms: Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Chlorine.
- Protons are positively charged.
- Electrons are negatively charged.
- Each atom has the unique number of protons.
```Protons + Neutrons = Mass Number```
- Most elements have two or more isotopes whose atoms differ in both mass number and neutral number.


### Electron Arrangement
- A cloud of negatively charged electrons surrounds the nucleus.
- In an uncharged atoms, **the number of electrons = the number of protons**.
- Electrons occupy energy levels called energy shells.
  - Innermost shell can hold at most two electrons, the next few shells can hold up to 8 electrons apiece.
  - The chemical properties of an atom depends on the # of electrons in its outermost electron shell.
  - An atom is most stable when its outermost shell is full.
  - Two electrons for hydrogen, eight election for larger items
- By transfering or sharing electrons, atoms can complete their outer shells and bond.

### Covalent Bonds
- A covalent bond is the sharing of outer-shell electrons by two atoms.
- E.g. Hydrogen has one electron but needs 2 complete its outer shell.
  - `H-H` covalent bond can be formed; each atom shares the other electron. The outer shell is completed.
- Other examples: CH4 (Methane), O2 (Oxygen), H2O (Water)

### Nonpolar and Polar Molecules
- **Electronegativity** - tendency for atoms to pull electrons towards themselves.
- In a covalent bond H-H, both nuclei have the same electronegativity. This is **nonpolar**.
- In a covalent bond H2O, the nucleus of oxygen attracts the electrons more; it 'hogs' it. 
  - Therefore, electrons spend more time around the oxygen molecule than the hydrogen molecules.
  - The oxygen molecule has a partial negative charge (electrons are negative).
  - The hydrogen molecules have a partial positive charge.
- Think: polar = skewed, drastically contrasting (poles).
  - If two atoms have same electronegativity, not polar
  - If two atoms have different electronegativity, is polar
- Think: electronegativity = magnet, the strength depends on the strength of the magnet itself as well as how far the object is from the magnet.

### Ionic Bonds
- Sometimes, atoms complete their outer shells by stealing or giving away atoms instead of sharing them.
- `ions` are formed when atoms lose or gain an electron to complete their shells.
- Electrical implications of ions
  - If an atom *loses* an electron, it has a positive charge (it lost a negatively-charged electrion).
  - If an atom *gains* an electron, it has a negative charge (it gained a negatively-charged electron.)

### Hydrogen Bonds
- Water molecules tend to stick together.
- Covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms are polar
  - Share electrons unequally
- Remember that in H2O water molecule:
  - Hydrogen molecule has slight positive charge
  - Oxygen molecule has slight negative charge
- If we have two hydrogen molecules `A` and `B`:
  - The oxygen molecule of `B` will attract to the hydrogen molecule of `A`
  - This is called a `hydrogen bond`.
  - We can continue stacking up several weak covalent bonds through it being polar (uneven).
- Many biological processes require on hydrogen bonds.
  - Keeps proteins folded in a three-dimensional shape.
  - Two strands of DNA held together by hydrogen bonds.

### The Polarity of Water
- Water has many properties
  - Takes lots of heat energy to change water
  - Individual water molecules are polar and stick together by hydrogen bonds
- Atoms in H2O are in a constant 'tug-of-war' for electrons.
- The polarity of water keeps it attracted to each other (hydrogen bonds)
- Each molecule can hydrogen bond to four other molecules
  - 2 unpaired electrons in oxygen atom
  - 1 unpaired electron in each hydrogen atom
- This gives water special properties like:
  - High boiling point
  - Surface tension

## Textbook Notes - Nucleic Acids and an RNA World
### 4.1: What is a Nucleic Acid?

#### Introduction
- Life began when chemicals evolved to the point where **molecules could promote their own replication**.
- `Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)` stores genetic information and is replicated using proteins.
- `RNA world hypothesis` says that there was a stage in life's evolution where `ribonucleic acid (RNA)` stored genetic information *and* catalyzed its own replication.
  - Did life on Earth begin with DNA first?
  - Did it do some replicating, evolving into a molecule just before RNA?
  - Did RNA precede DNA and proteins?

#### Nucleic Acids
- Nucleic acids are `polymers`, like proteins.
- **Instead of being assembled from amino acids, nucleic acids are made up of `nucleotides`**.
- There are three components of a nucleotide.
  - A phosphate group.
  - A five-carbon sugar.
    - A central component in the nucleotide.
    - Five carbons in the sugar are usually labelled with numbers and prime (`'`) symbols. For example, base is attached to 1' carbon and phosphate group attached to 5' carbon.
  - A nitrogenous (contains nitrogen) base.
- Phosphate group bonds to a sugar molecule, which bonds to the base.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| ribonucleotides | monomers of RNA (ribonucleic acid). sugar is ribose. |
| deoxyribonucleotide | monomers of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). sugar is deoxyribus. |
| deoxy- | prefix for 'lacking oxygen'. |

#### Nitrogenous Bases
- `purines` - consist of double rings formed from nine atoms.
  - adenine (A) (note - has 'nine' in name)
  - guanine (G) (note - has 'nine' in name)
- `pyrimidines` - consist of single rings formed from six atoms.
  - cytosine (C)
  - uracil (U) (used by ribonucleotides)
  - thymine (T) (used by deoxyribonucleotides)

#### Drawing Nucleotides
phosphate
: usually represented as a circle.

sugar
: usually represented as a pentagon with an upright tail.

nitrogenous base
: usually represented as a hexagon.

covalent bond
: usually represented with a line.
  
#### Chemical Evolution in the Production of Nucleotides
- If nucleic acids played a role in chemical evolution of life, then there **must have been at least some nucleotides present in prebiotic oceans**.
- Most biologists _accept the idea that `amino acids` could have been synthesized early in Earth's history_.
  - Nitrogenous bases and types of sugars[^1] can be synthesized under conditions like those in early Earth oceans, particularly deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems.
    - Reactive minerals on the surface of walls in deep-sea vents **bind to ribose, effectively enriching and concentrating ribose[^2] from a pool of diverse sugars.**

#### How do Nucleotides Polymerize to Form Nucleic Acids?
- **Once nucleotides formed, how would they polymerize to form nucleic acids?
- Nucleotides polymerize through `condensation reactions` between hydroxyl on sugar component of one nucleotide and phosphate group of another nucleotide.
  - *Forms a new covalent bond between the two nucleotides, and a molecule of water is released*.
- Bridge formed by phosphate group called `phosphodiester linkage` (phosophodiester bond).
- When phosphodiester linkages join ribonucleotides together, the polymer produced is RNA.
- Phosphodiester linkages between deoxyribonucleotides produces DNA.

#### DNA and RNA Strands Are Directional
- A chain of linked sugars and phosphates in a nucleic acid acts as a backbone.
- The phosphate backbone of a nucleic acid is **directional**.
  - In a strand of RNA/DNA,
    - One end has an unlinked 5' phosphate
    - Another end has an unlinked 3' hydroxyl
- Order of different nucleotides forms the primary structure of the nucleic acid.
- Sequence of bases in RNA/DNA is always written in a 5' to 3' direction. 
  - This is logical; RNA and DNA are synthesized in this direction.
  - Nucleotides are only added at 3' end.

#### Polymerization Requires an Energy Source
- The joining of nucleotides into nucleic acids decreases entropy and therefore **is not spontaenous**.
- Energy is needed to tip the balance _in favor of polymerization).
- Nucleic acid polymerization can take place in cells b/c potential energy of nucleotides are raised by reactions that **add +2 phosphate groups to the 5' phosphates of ribonucleoside or deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates**, which create `nucleoside triphosphates`'.
- Nucleoside triphosphates are activated nucleotides; adenosine triphosphate, `ATP`.
  - Equivalent **used in DNA synthesis**: deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP).
- Phosphates are **negatively charged**, and charges repel.
  - Linking 2 or more phosphates together creates *covalent bonds* that carry lots of potential energy.
  - Energy is released when phosphates form new, more stable bonds with *other atoms.*

### 4.2: DNA Structure and Function
- Primary structure of DNA is similar to primary strucutre of proteins.
- DNA molecules have a sugar-phosphate backbone created by phosphodiester linkages and a sequence of any of 4 bases that extend from it.
- DNA also has a secondary structure.

#### The Nature of DNA's Secondary Structure
- Discovery of DNA's secondary structure was one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century.
- Many clues as to the structure of DNA:
  - Chemists knew the molecule had a sugar-phosphate backbone.
  - Number of purines in a DNA molecule equal to number of pyridines, #T = #A, #C = #G.
  - Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins used `X-ray crystallography` to find distances between groups of atoms in the molecule.
    - Three distances were repeated: 0.34, 2.0, 3.4 nm[^3]
    - Could infer a regular and repeating structure.

#### Antiparallel Double Helix
- Watson and Crick analyzed the size and geometry of 3 nucleotide components:
  - Deoxyribose
  - Phosphate
  - Base
- Determined that:
  - the distance of 2.0 nm represented the width of the helix
  - the distance of 0.34 nm was the distance between bases stacked in a spiral
- Observations:
  - only purine-pyrimidine fits in the 2-nm wide sugar-phosphate backbone.
    - purine-purine too big, pyrimidine-pyrimidine too small
  - complimentary base pairing based on hydrogen bonding
  - patterns of hydrogen bonding could form only if bases are opposite strands flipped 180 degrees relative. These are `antiparallel`.
  - antiparallel strands predicted to form a `double helix`.
- Carbon-nitrogen rings are mostly nonpolar, although each base has polar groups for hydrogen bonds.
  - In aqueous solutions[^4], hydrophobic interactions caused DNA **to twist into a helix to minimize contact between hydrophobic base and water molecules**.
- Strands are stabilized by **base stacking**.
  - Results from van der Waals interactions between adjacent bases.
  - Rotated orientation of interior base pairs lets rings of adjacent bases stack on top of each other like coins.
  - Double helix is hydrophilic overall and soluble in aqueous solutions.
- **Major and minor grooves** allow access to proteins.

#### Summary of Antiparallel Double Helix
The double helix is shaped and stabilized by hydrogen bonding between complementary base pairs, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interactions.

#### Tertiary Structure of DNA
- DNA in cells is found in compact three-dimensional structures.
- Total length of DNA in each cell is about 6 feet long. Needs to be compact.
- When DNA becomes wound too tightly or losely, it twists on itself to form **supercoils**, which are compact and 3-dimensional structures.

#### DNA as an Information-Encoding Molecule
- Watson and Crick's model revealed DNA as a biological resevoir of information.
- Information consists of a sequence of nucleotides in nucleic acid.
- Four nitrogenous bases are like letters in an alphabet.
- **DNA stores important information**.
- DNA can perform its own synthesis.
  1. Separate strand; break complementary base pairs.
    - This can be done by breaking hydrogen bonds with heat or enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
  2. Each strand of DNA serves as a template for formation of a new strand.
    - Template strand is combined with complementary strand.
  3. Strands polymerize to form sugar-pohsphate backbone.
    - Produces two identical daughter molecules.
- Does the structure of DNA allow it to be replicated?
> It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism. -Watson and Crick

#### The DNA Double Helix is a Stable Structure
- DNA is highly structured; regular, symmetric, held together.
- DNA from fossils that are 10k-s of years old; they are the same sequence of bases as when they were alive.
- Stability of DNA reveals why **it is so effective as information storage**.
- Structure of DNA is simple and nonreactive; never ben observed to cataylze any reaction in any organism.
- No support for the idea that life began with DNA alone; instead, life began with RNA.

### 4.3 RNA Structure and Function
#### Structural Differences Between RNA & DNA
- Primary structure
  - RNA has a primary structure of four types of nitrogenous bases from a sugar-phosphate backbone.
  - Two differences:
    1. Sugar in sugar-phosphate backbone is ribose, not deoxyribose.
    2. Pyrimidine base thymine does not exist in RNA; uses a related base, uracil.
  - Hydroxyl (OH) group in 2' carbon of ribose is much more reactive than hydrogen atom on 2' carbon of deoxyribose.
  - Hydroxyl group can attack phosphate linkage between nucleotides when RNA molecules fold in different ways.
    - Generates a break in the sugar-phosphate backbone.
  - The extra hydroxyl group makes RNA less stable than DNA.
- Secondary structure
  - RNA molecules have secondary structure that results from complementary base pairing between purine and pyrimidine bases.
  - purine and pyrmidine bases in RNA usually hydrogen bond *with complementary bases in the same strand*, rather than in a different strand.
  - Within-strand base pairing: one part of the RNA strand folds over and aligns with bases on another part of the same strand.
    - Hydrogen bonding with complimentary bases results in a helical structure like the double helix of DNA.
    - Stem-and-loop configuration.
- Tertiary structure
  - RNA molecules have tertiary structure that arises when secondary structures fold into more complex shapes.
  - _Pseudoknot structure_ is an example of 3-d shapes formed by base pairing in distant regions of folded RNA molecules.
  - RNA molecules with different base sequences can have different shapes and chemical properties.
    - More diverse in size, shape, and reactivity than DNA molecules.

#### Tabular Version - DNA vs RNA Structure

| Level of Structure | DNA | RNA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | Sequence of deoxyribonucleotides: bases are A, T, G, C | Sequence of ribonucleotides: bases are A, U, G, C |
| Secondary | Two antiparallel strands twist into a double helix, stabilized by hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interactions | Single strand folds back on itself to form a double-helical 'stem' and an unpaired 'loop'. |
| Tertiary | Double helical DNA forms compact structures by wrapping around histone proteins or twisting into supercoils. | Secondary structures fold to form a wide variety of distinctive three-dimensional shape. |

#### RNA's Versatility
- RNA molecules are highly versatile.
  - A nucleic acid like DNA, but RNA folds into complex three-dimensional shapes like proteins.
- Structural flexibility of RNA molecules lets them perform many tasks.
  - Central dogma introduced RNA as an intermediate between DNA and protein.
  - Messenger RNA transmits information needed to synthesize polypeptides.
  - RNA molecules help regulate the production of messenger RNA from DNA, process and edit information stored in messages, and catalyze synthesis of proteins.

#### RNA Can Function as a Catalytic Molecule
- Four types of nucleotides in RNA molecules are no match for 20 amino acid residues in proteins.
- RNA has a degree of structural and chemical complexity.
- Capable of forming structures that catalyze a number of chemical reactions.
- RNAs are called ribozymes (RNA enzymes), catalyze reactions similar to protein enzymes.
  - Ribozyme catalyzes hydrolysis and condensation of phosphodiester linkages in RNA.
  - Ribozymes catalyze important reactions in cells.
  - For example, responsible for catalytic activity of ribosomes that polymerize amino acids to form polypeptides.
- 3-dimensional nature of ribozymes are vital to catalytic activity.
- Ribozymes were a watershed event in origin-of-life research.
- The fact that ribozymes could catalyze formations of phosphodiester bonds raised the possibility that RNA could polymerize a copy of itself; such a molecule would be the first living identity.

## Video Notes on Nucleic Acids

### Nucleic Acid Structure
- **DNA polymer** - one of two twisted stands that make up a DNA molecule.
- Cells make nucleic acid polymers by linking together **four types of monomers, called nucleotides**.
- Each nucleotide consists of a
  - Sugar (deoxyribose in DNA)
  - Phosphate group
  - Nitrogen-containing[^1] base (G, A, C, T)
- Letters in a sentence, sequence of nucleotides carries information.
- The DNA of every organism has a unique nucleotide sequence.
  - DNA can be millions of nucleotides in length.
- DNA consists of two strands of nucleotides that twist around each other.
  - This forms a double helix.
  - Strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of nitrogenous bases.
  - `A` pairs with `T`, `G` pairs with `C`.

- **RNA Polymer** - typically single-stranded.
- Instead of deoxyribose, has a sugar called ribose.
- Uses a different base (uracil, U) instead of thyamine (T).
- Copied from part from part of DNA, so shorter than DNA.
  - Dozens to thousands of nucleotides.

### Tips on Drawing DNA Sequences
- DNA molecules are large, complex, & important.
- There are many different models for DNA.
- Use models that ignore most of DNA structure, but be familiar with the basics *so you know what it represents*.
- Double-stranded DNA is **shaped like a ladder**.
  - Uprights made of **sugars** and **phosphate groups**.
  - Rungs made of nitrogenous bases that come in four varieties (G with C, A with T)
- **How is genetic information stored in DNA?**
  - Particular sequence of letters (-T-C-T-A-G-C-)
  - Thousands of letters in a sequence of gene.
  - The sequence of gene determines the physical trait.
  - If a mutation occurs, causing change in DNA sequence, the protein may change.
- Only focus on a small segment of a gene.
  - In general, plants with similar DNAs are likely to be more related.

### Tips on Drawing Nucleotides
- Molecules like nucleotides are hard to see because they are so small.
- Space-filling models are difficult to see; structural formula is better.
- Ribose
  - OH group at 2' and 3' carbon
- Deoxyribose
  - OH group at 3', H group at 2' carbon
- Simplification!
  - Leave out hydrogens and carbons, which are implied by corners of the model.
  - Sugar left to a pentagon, if different types of sugar not necessary.
  - Phosphate group as sugar connected by 5' carbon item.
  - Nitrogenous base as a hexagon with letter indicating type.
  - Simplified model useful to draw several nucleotides.

### Tips on Drawing Nucleic Acids
- DNA is a type of nucleic acid, which is a polymer of nucleotides.
- When nucleotides polymerize, a covalent bond forms between the three-prime carbon of one sugar molecule and the phosphate group of another.
- The phosphate groups and sugars form the backbone.
  - Arrowhead represents the side of the chain where the 3' carbon has a free OH group.
- In the other strand, they are reversed.
- Nitrogenous bases pair in the center and pair in a specific way.
  - One-ring cytosine form three hydrogen bonds with double-ring guanine.
  - One-ring thyamine forms three hydrogen bonds with double-ring adenine.

### ATP Hydrolysis
- What is the source of acid used for nucleic acid polymerization?
- Monomers of nucleic acids are nucleotides. Imagine them moving around in a disordered manner.
  - Nucleotides are organized by condensation reactions, become ordered.
- In spontaneous reactions:

| From | To |
| :---: | :---: |
| Reactants | Products |
| High potential energy | Low potential energy |
| Low entropy | High entropy |

- The process is not spontaneous, because entropy does not decrease.
- Nucleotide activiation is **activated with more phosphates**.
  - Each phosphate has a negative charge.
  - Repulsion between negative charges makes bonds between phosphates weak.
  - Increase potential energy.
  - Potential to form new, stronger bonds has increased.
- Condensation reactions.
  - Two phosphates are removed in one nucleotide and the remaining phosphate makes a strong bond with the 3' carbon in another nucleotide.
  - Different in bond strength releases heat.
  - Condensation reactions with activated nucleotides are spontaneous.
    - Increase in molecular motion as heat is released increases entropy.
- ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate.
  - Activated nucleotide.
  - When ATP + H2O, splits into AMP[^2] + inorganic pyrophosphate (2 phosphate molecules), which have formed stronger bonds with water.
  - Decrease in potential energy. 
  - Hydrolysis. Released as heat.

### The Double Helix
- 3-dimensional arrangement of molecules must explain stability of life (traits passed) and the mutability of life (change fo evolution to happen).
- Genes - located inside the nucleus of cells, associated with chromosomes.
- Genes needed to be made of DNA or proteins
  - DNA doesn't seem very interesting - repeated units of phosphate, sugar, and bases.
  - This view persisted for a long time.
- Powerful technique for solving molecular structure: x-ray crystallography.
  - Determine position of every single atom in the molecule with respect to every other molecule.
  - DNA is not an easy molecule to work with.
- Maurice Wilkins - trained as a physicist, drawn to problem of the gene.
  - Rosalind Franklin; talented crytallographer.
  - Recipe for disaster; worked against each other often.
- Biological molecules come in many shapes.
  - Suspected DNA might be a helix of some kind.
  - How would the bases arrange?
- Initially, Watson and Crick's the model was wrong (bases on the outside). Franklin dismissed their effort.
- Pauling preparing a copy of DNA; a triple helix similar to the one that they had been shamed in abandoning.
- Photo 51, diffraction pattern was a helix.
  - A double helix, not a triple helix.
  - The two backbones led in opposite directions.
  - The bases need to be on the inside.
- The number of As and Ts was the same, the number of Gs and Cs was the same.
- Discovered the arrangement of the bases, which revealed how DNA works.
- Complimentary nature of DNA. Could easily make a new complimentary copy just be obeying pairing rules. Solved gene replication.
- Answers how information is stored and how mutations emerge.

### RNA Folding
- When nucleic acid is relieved of being locked with another strand, it can take on any shape it wants to (does not need to be a double helix).
- RNA structues are more varied than what DNA can be.
- Can interact with itself.
- Can achieve what, for instance, a protein molecule can achieve.
- Not just an informational molecule, but a biocatalyst.

## Textbook Notes - Chemical Evolution

### 2.3: Chemical Reactions, Energy, and Chemical Evolution
- Chemical evolution theory supporters say **simple molecules in the atmosphere and oceans participated in reactions that produced larger and more complex molecules.**

- Two environments.
  - *The atmosphere* in early Earth had many gases (from volcanoes). Water vapor, carbon dioxide, & nitrogen primarily, molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide in lesser numbers.
  - *Deep-sea hydrothermal vents* were where very hot rocks contacted cracks in the seafloor. Deep-sea vents have lots of gases like carbon dioxide and molecular hydrogen, as well as *reactive metals like nickel & iron*.
- *Very little happens when CO2, N2, H2, CO, and water vapor interact on their own.*
  - How did these molecules evolve to produce large and complex substances in living cells?
  
#### How do Chemical Reactions Happen?
- Take, for example, gases that come out of volcanoes to produce carbonic acid:
  - `CO2(*g*) + H2O(*g*) ⇌ CH2O3(*aq*)`
  - The expression is balanced.
    - 1 carbon atom
    - 3 oxygen atoms
    - 2 hydrogen atoms
  
  - `chemical (*state*)` indicates the state of the chemical.
    - `l` for liquid.
    - `g` for gas.
    - `aq` for aqueous.
  
###### Systems & Surroundings, Law of Conservation of Mass 
 - Interacting molecules are *systems*, and everything else is the *surroundings*.
  - Ignore surroundings and focus on the system.
  - `System` as being closed relative to its surroundings.
  - *Mass of reactants always equal to mass of products.*

- `Law of Conservation of Mass`
  - Mass cannot be created or destroyed.
  - It must be rearranged through chemical reactions.

###### Chemical Equilibrium
- Chemical equilibrium (indicated by ⇌).
  - Driving reactions
    - `CO2(*g*) + H2O(*g*) ⇌ CH2O3(*aq*)`
    - Adding more CO2 will drive the reaction to the right, creating more CH2O3.
    - Removing CO2 or adding more CH2O3 will drive the reaction to the left.
  - Temperature
    - `H2O(l) ⇌ H2O(g)` (liquid water and water vapor).
    - Equilibrium cna be altered by changes in temperature.
    - System absorbs thermal energy from surrounding environment; liquid water molecules change from liquid to gas.

###### Endothermic and Exothermic Changes
- When thermal energy is *absorbed* by the system, it is *endothermic* ('within heating').
  - `H2O(l) → H2O(g)` is endothermic. Energy is absorbed to vaporize liquid water.
  
- When thermal energy is *released* to the surroundings, it is *exothermic* ('outside heating').
  - `H2O(g) → H2O(l)` is exothermic. Energy is released when the environment is cooled and vaporized water turns into liquid water

#### What is Energy?
- `Energy` - the capacity to do work or supply heat.
  - Capacity: stored potential or active motion.
  
###### Potential Energy & Chemical Energy
- Stored energy is `potential energy`.
- An object gains or loses its ability to store energy b/c of its position.
- Potential energy is related to sharing electrons in covalent bonds.
  - Electrons far from atomic nuclei, bond is long and weak.
    - Greater capacity to be broken apart into new, stronger bonds during reaction.
  - Electrons closer to one or both atoms, bond becomes short and strong.
    - Lesser capacity to be broken apart into new, stronger bonds during reaction.
- Molecule's `chemical energy` is its ability to form stronger bonds is a type of potential energy.

###### Bond Strength
- Electronegativities of atoms affect positionof shared electrons.
- Example:
  - Unequal sharing (polar), low potential energy, short & strong bonds.
    - `O-H`. (All electrons are with O, which has much higher electronegativity).
  - Mostly equal sharing, increasing potential energy, medium-length & power bonds.
    - `N-H`. (Electrons are relatively in the middle, but nitrogen has a slightly larger electronegativity than hydrogen.)
  - Equal electron sharing, high potential energy, long & weak bonds.
    - `C-H`. (Electrons are equally shared b/c both have same weak electronegativities.)

###### Kinetic Energy and Thermal Energy
- Energy of motion is `kinetic energy`.
  - All molecules have at least a little kinetic energy because they are always moving.
  - Kinetic energy in molecular motion is `thermal energy`.
- Thermal energy.
  - `Temperature` of an object measures how much thermal neergy a molecule possesses.
    - Cold object has low temperature. Molecules are moving slower.
    - Hot object has high temperature. Molecules are moving faster.
  - Two objects with diffferent temperatures that come into contact undergo heat transfer.

###### First Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy is conserved.
  - It cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred.
- Energy can only change from one form to another.

###### Heat's Role in Earth's Beginnings
- Energy transformation is at the ❤️️ of chemical evolution.
  - Molecules in early Earth were exposed to lots of energy.
- Kinetic energy (in the form of heat) was present in cooling molten mass that formed the planet.
- Atmosphere and surface of Earth heavily exposed to electricity.
  - Lightning & radiation from the Sun.
- Energy was stored in the chemical bonds of molecules.

#### What Makes a Chemical Reaction Spontaneous?
- **Chemical reactions are spontaneous if they can happen on their own.**
  - Do not need any additional influence, like added energy.
  
- Two factors determining if a reaction is spontaneous.
  - *Products have lower potential energy than reactants.*
    - Shared electrons in products are more tightly held than those in reactants.
    - `2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)`
      - Electrons in O-H bonds of water are held more tightly than in H-H and O=O bonds.
      - Products have lower potential energy than reactants.
      
  - *Product molecules are less ordered than reactant molecules.
    - Glucose is a single, highly ordered molecule.
    - When glucose burns in air, breaks into gaseous CO2 and H2O(g).
      - Are less ordered than reactant glucose molecules.
  
###### Entropy
- Entropy is the amount of disorder in a system or surrounding environment.
  - Entropy increases when the products of a chemical reaction are less ordered than reactant molecules.
- Spotaneous reactions can occur without *appearing* to increase the entropy.
  - `2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)`
    - Potential energy drops.
    - Difference in potential energy released as **heat and light**.
      - Vaporizes the water produced.
- Potential energy & entropy can be used to determine if a reaction is spontaneous or not.
  
###### Second Law of Thermodynamics
- In all spontaneous reactions, entropy *always* increases.
  - Must consider both the system *and* the environment.
- Consider *The Hindenburg*.
  - `2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)`.
    - Molecular hydrogen and diatomic oxygen.
    - Combine to release lots of energy.

### 2.4: Investigating Chemical Evolution
- Chemical evolution proposed by Alexander I. Oparin in 1924.
  - Today, considered a formal scientific theory.

- Answe tehq eustion:
  - Can complex organic[^1] compounds be synthesized from simple molecules in Earth's early sphere?
    - Recreate stpes of chemical evolution in laboratory?
  
#### Miller's Experiment
- Experimental setup designed to produce a microcosm of early Earth.
- Large glass flask: represents the atmosphere.
  - Contained gases CH4, NH3, H2 (high potential energy).
- Connected to a smaller flask by glass tubing.
  - Tiny ocean (200mL of `H2O(l)`).
- Miller constantly boiled the water.
  - This added `H2O(g)` to the large-flask gases.
  - Vapor cooled and condensed; flowed back into smaller flask (boiled again)
    - Water vapor circulated continuously throughout the system.
    - 'Rain' may carry atmosphere interactions into the 'ocean'.
- Cannot just boil molecules.
  - Even at boiling point, starting molecules are stable.
  - Do not undergo spontaneous chemical reactions.
    - Different form of energy needed for substances to react.
- Miller sent electrial discharges to electrodes in the atmosphere.
  - 'Lightning bolts' added pulses of intense electrical energy.

- **Results.**
  - Days of continuous boiling and sparking, solution was pink.
  - After a week, was deep red and cloudy.
  - Mini-ocean had lots of hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde.
    - Chemicals are poisonous, but highly reactive.
      - Can promote synthesis of larger and more complex compounds.
    - Samples contained **amino acids**.
      - Building blocks of proteins.

###### Formal Description of Miller's Experiment

| Aspect | Content |
| --- | -------------------- |
| Question | Can simple molecules and kinetic energy lead to chemical evolution? |
| Hypothesis | Chemical evolution of organic molecules will occur in environments simulating early Earth conditions. |
| Null Hypothesis | Chemical evolution will not occur in early Earth simulations. |
| Prediction of Hypothesis | If kinetic energy is added to a mix of simple molecules, complex organic compounds will be produced. |
| Prediction of Null Hypothesis | No complex organic compounds will be produced. |
| Results | Samples from solution contained formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and several complex compounds with C=C bonds, like amino acids (e.g. glycine). |
| Conclusion | Chemical evolution occurs readily if simple moelcules with high free energy are exposed to a source of kinetic energy.

## Textbook Notes - Chemical Evolution - 4.4 In Search of the First Life-Form

### Introduction
- Theory of chemical evolution: **life began as a self-replicator**
  - `Self-replicator`: a moelcule that existed by itself in solution *without being enclosed in a membrane.
- To make copies:
  1. Provide a template that could be copied.
  2. Catalyze polymerization reactions that link monomers into a copy of the template.
- **Origin of life researchers propose the first life form was RNA.**
- RNA is a sequence of bases analoous to letters.
  - It can function as an information-containing molecule.
  - Information in RNA can be used to make copies via complementary base pairing.

### The Process of RNA Synthesis/Copying
1. To replicate a single-stranded DNA, create a complementary copy of RNA.
  - The original strand is used as a template.
  - Free ribonucleotides form hydrogen bonds w/ complementary bases on template.
2. The strand is polymerized when 3' hydroxyls and 5' phosphates on adjacent nucleotides link together via condensation reactions.
  - Result: double-stranded RNA molecule.
3. Hydrogen bonds broken by heating or catalyzed reaction.
  - Newly made complementary RNA molecule exists independent of original template.
  
### How Biologists Study the RNA World
- Researchers test RNA world hypothesis by **establishing an environment in the lab that selects ribozymes that catalyze key steps required in RNA world.**
- Two experiments in David Bartel's laboratory:
  - Generate a RNA molecule that could catalyze template polymerization.
    - Mimic process of natural selection, target characteristics of molecules instead of organisms.
    - Isolated a ribozyme that could add 14 nucleotides to an RNA strand.
  - Select a ribozyme that could *make* RNA nucleotides.
    - Began with a large pool of randomly generated RNA sequences.
    - Selected RNAs that could catalyze the addition of a uracil base to ibose sugar.
    - Purified a ribozyme that could perform this task 1 million times more efficiently than uncatalyzed reaction.
      - Molecular evolution occured in reaction tubes.
- Biologists are producing impressive catalytic activites from RNA molecules.

### An RNA World May Have Sparked the Evolution of Life
- Most discovered ribozymes exist in modern cells and play important roles in protein synthesis.
- If ribozymes removed from cells, **proteins would no longer be made.**
  - suggests: **RNA preceded proteins.**
- Evolution of protein enzymes marked the end of the RNA world.
  - It provided the means to catalyze reactions for life to emerge in cellular form.
- Established 3/5 characteristics of life:
  1. **Information.** Proteins and ribozymes process information in nucleic acids to synthesize proteins.
  2. **Replication.** Enzymes (and maybe riboyzmes) replicate nucleic acids that store hereditary information.
  3. **Evolution.** Random changes in nucleic acids can lead to the synthesis of different proteins & ribozyes. This can allow for evolution of new functions.
- If this happened in a hydrothermal vent:
  - Molecular assemblages of nucleic acids & proteins constantly fed thermal & chemical energy.
  - Enzymes moust have evolved to store energy in something more portable.

## Textbook Notes - Chemical Evolution - 2.4 Origin-of-Life Experiments and the Two Models



### Recent Origin-of-Life Experiments
\*Comes from 2.4 of Edition 6 of textbook.
- Production of complex molecules from simple molecules supports claim that the formation of a 'prebiotic soup' was possible.
- Researchers pointed out that early atmosphere had `CO`, `CO2`, and `H2`, not `CH4` and `NH3` (used in Miller's experiment).
- Follow-up experiments occuring under more realistic conditions.

#### Synthesis of Precursors Using Light Energy
- Synthesis of formaldehyde from carbon dioxide & hydrogen.
  - `CO2(g) + 2 H2(g) → CH2O(g) + H2O(g)`
  - Researchers show formaldehyde molecules can react with each other to produce large organic compounds, like sugars.
  - Does not occur spontaneously.
- Research group *constructed computer model of Earth's early atmosphere.*
  - Model listed all possible chemical reactions that could occur.
  - Included reactions that occur **when molecules are struck by sunlight.**
    - Light is a source of energy.
  - Computer moldel included reactions that produce highly reactive free radicals.
    - `CO2(g) + 2 H2(g) + sunlight → CH2O(g) + H2O(g)`
    - Balances energy involved.
- **Energy in sunlight could be converted into chemical energy by generating radicals that spontaneously form bonds in formaldehyde.**
- Similar model: researchers show that hydrogen cyanide was an important precursor of molecules required for life.
  - Organic compounds with relatively high potential energy could have accumulated, and groundowrk would have been in place for the prebiotic soup model of chemical revolution.

###### Free Radicals
- Inferred chemical evolution occured when large quantities of high-energy photons bomboarded the planet.
- Atoms in hydrogen moelcules and `CO2` molecules have full valence shells through covalent bonding.
  - Makes molecules unreactive.
- Energy in the form of photons or *intense electrical energy in lightning* (like in Miller's experiment) can break up molecules by knocking apart shared electrons.
  - Fragments that result are **free radicals.**
  - Have unpaired electrons in their outermost shells and are very reactive.

#### Concentration and Catalysis in Hydrothermal Vents
- **Stumbling block in prebiotic soup model:** preucrsor molecules would have become diluted when they entered the early oceans.
  - Without concentration, how could formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide meet and form large, complex molecules?
- **Surface metabolism model:** reactants recruited in a defined space.
  - Layer of reactive minerals in walls of deep sea-vent chimneys.
  - Dissolved gases attracted by minerals and concentated on vent-wall surfaces.
- Not only would vent wall minerals bring reactants together, but **be critical to the rate of reactant product formation.**
  - Potential reactions can be spontaneous but would not occur[^1] without a **catalyst.**
  
###### As a Catalyst
- Catalysts provide appropriate chemical environment for reactants to interact with each other.
  - Example: synthesis of acetic acid from carbon dioxide and hydrogen:
    - `2 CO2(aq) + 4 H2(aq) → CH3COOH(aq) + 2 H2O(l)`
    - Spontaneous reaction driven by chemical energy stored in `H2`.
- Importance:
  - Acetic acid can be formed under conditions that simulate a hydrothermal vent environment.
  - Key intermediate in ancient metabolic pathway that produces acetyl CoA, a molecule used by cells throughout tree of life.

###### Evidence of Vent Minerals as Catalysts
- Vent minerals *could* have served as catalysts in synthesis of acetic acid.
- Catalysts perform the same reactions in modern cells contain minerals *similar* to those found in hydrothermalv ents.
  - Preliminary results: a variety of carbon-based molecules are formed under early Earth conditions.
  - Precursors of synthesis of nucleotides.


#### The Two Theories

| Theory | Process |
| --- | ------------------ |
| Prebiotic Soup Model | Simple molecules like `N2`, `NH3`, and `CO` were present in the atmosphere of ancient earth. Energy in sunlight drove reactions among simple molecules to produce molecules like `formaldehyde` and `hydrogen cyanide`. Stimulated by heat, the products formed more complex molecules like `ribose`, `glycine`, and `acetaldehyde`. |
| Surface Metabolism Model | Simple molecules like `N2`, `NH3`, and `CO` were present in early oceans and hydrothermal events. Vent minerals catalyzed spontaneous reactions among high-energy molecules to produce, for instance, `acetic acid`. Concentration and heat formed more complex molecules like ribose.

## Video Notes on Chemical Evolution

### Figure Walkthrough: Potential Energy Change During Chemical Reactions
- What makes a chemical reaction spontaneous?
  - Large drop in potential energy as reactants converted to products.
- What causes the change in energy?
- Reactants: `2 H2` + `O2`.
  - Covalent bonds. Electrons are shared equally
  - Form nonpolar covalent bonds.
  - Same electronegativities.
  - Are held 'losely'.
- Product: `2 H2O`.
  - Two water molecules.
  - Bonds are polar covalent; oxygen atom has higher electronegativity than hydrogen.
  - Shared electrons are held 'tightly'.
  - Polar bonds have lower potential energy.
- High potential energy to low potential energy.
  - Difference in potential energy means there is a drop in energy; what happened to the rest of the energy?
  - Changed to kinetic energy and released in heat and light.
  - Many reactions form a very powerful energy outburst.

### What Was the Miller-Urey Experiment?
- Once believed that leaving food out to rot would cause animals to suddenly appear.
  - Spontaneous generation.
- "Omne vivum ex vivo", life only comes from life.
  - Rats, maggots, microbes are too complex to simply 'poof' into existent.
- Drawin: theory of evolution.
  - Under the right situations, simple creatures turn into more complex ones.
- Is it possible that simple life cells could come from nonliving matter?
  - Alexander Oparin published "The Origin of Life'
    - Thoughts on the progression of life:
      1. Simple molecules
      2. Molecules of life (biomonomers)
      3. Macromolecules
      4. Polymer Complexes
      5. Metabolic Networks
      6. Living Cells
    - Early ocean as a soup of complex molecules produced by natural reactions.

- How to test or observe?
- Stanley Miller came up with an idea: simulate early Earth conditions in a lab.
- Simulated early water conditions.
  - Added hydrogen, ammonia, and methane.
  - Added a condensor to cool the atmosphere, allowing water molecules to fall into ocean like rain.
  - Added sparks in the atmosphere to simulate lightning.
- Not to create life, but test simple molecules to biomonomers.


- Oceans had amino acids and other complex molecules.
- Gave rise to a field of reearch: prebiotic chemistry.
- Scientist's don't know if gases used by Miller were the most accurate.
  - Experiments show many different sources of environments work.
- Molecules of life formed everywhere.
- Significant:
  - Not perfect simulation, but demonstrated that biomolecules can form from simple molecules.
  - Transformed speculation into science.

### Steven Hawking Asks What Are the Building Blocks of Life and How Did They Come to Be
- How did biological machinery come about?
- Amino acids
  - Early building blocks of life.
  - How did they first form?
- 4 billion years back in time
  - Where do basic building blocks come from?
    - Randomly appear?
  - Stanley Miller & Harold Urey
- Magnets as atoms.
- When energy is applied, interesting things happen.
  - Amino acids and molecules can form by themselves.
  - Just need the right energy and the right surroundings.
- Proteins from amino acids.
  - Miller produced 5 amino acids.

### What is Chemical Evolution?
- The first living cells came about through *chemical evolution*.
- *Evolution*: Change over time.
- *Biological evolution*: Changes in things that are able to reproduce.
  - Not random change - adaptive change. Better able to survive in their environments.
  - Requires:
    - Reproduction
    - Variation
    - Selection
- *Chemical evolution*: How do things become reproducible?
  - Chemical system: groups of molecules that interact with each other.
  - Often evolve towards simplicity.
    - Iron corrodes to rust.
    - Proteins break down when exposed to heat.
  - Simple chemistry arises into something complex.

- Chemical evolution needs:
  - Repetitive production
    - Does not depend on reproduction. In fact, answers 'reproduction' component in biological evolution.
  - Variation
  - Selection
- Powerful natural events take place naturally.
  - Heating, cooling (day night)
  - Eruptions of volcanic geysers
  - Rise and fall of oceans
  - Repetitively produce new molecules and systems.
- 'Living' components automatically form.
  - Fatty Acid concentrations that are high enough bunch into a ball.
  - Fatty Acids form skins; edges can fuse together.
  - 'Hollow container' similar to skin of a living cell.
  - Can trap other molecules inside and act as an entirely new environment.
  - Fatty acid membrane.
    - Cannot live by themselves, but the development of these and other components demonstrate important principles of chemical energy.
- Chemistry can give rise to life.

  - Gave rise to every one of billions of species in our planet since.
- Earth was almost entirely devoid of a suitable environment for living things in its early days.
  - Widespread volcanic activity
  - Atmosphere with hostile conditions.
- Elements and compounds for life: hydrogen, nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, phosphate, ammonia.
  - How to co-mingle and react?
  - Need a solvent: water.
- All life needs a source of energy.
- Life forms:
  - Autotrophs. Plants, generate their onw energy.
  - Heterotrophs. Animals, consume other organisms for their energy.
  - First organism: autotrophy.
- Locations that meet criteria.
  - Places on land or close to surface of ocean have access to sunlight.
  - UV radiation on Earth's surface was too harsh for life to survive.
  - Hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor are covered in seawater.
- **Hydrothermal vent**
  - Fissure in Earth's crust.
  - Seawater seeps into the magma chambers and is ejected back out at high temperatures with rich minerals and simple compounds.
  - Energy is concentrated in chemical gradients of thermal vents.
- **Last Universal Common Ancestor** (LUCA)
  - What does LUCA look like?
  - Scientists identify genes across three domains of life.
    - Archaea, bacteria, eukarya
  - Must have been inherited in a common ancestor.
  - LUCA lived in a hot, oxygen-free place and harvested energy from a chemical gradient.
- Two tkinds of hydrothermal vent
  - Black smoker. Release acidic, carbon dioxide rich water, heated to 100s of degrees Clesius. Packed with metals essential to life. **Too hot for LUCA.**
  - White smoker. Probably it.
- Lost City favored for the cradle of life.

### Life's Rocky Start | Deep Sea Vents
- [Source](https://kcts9.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/buac16-912-sci-ess-nvlrsvents/wgbh-nova-lifes-rocky-start-deep-sea-vents/)
- Dark ocean floor - more than a mile below the surface - explorers found mineral-rich hydrothermal vents.
  - Like underwater volcanoes.
- Reached almost 600 degrees; yet life *thrived.**
- **Not off the sun's energy, but chemical energy.**
  - life can thrive without sunlight.
  - Extreme temperature and pressure; yet extreme to us is **not extreme to microbes.**
  - Could this dark and unlikely environment be where life began?
- Life's building blocks in the conditions of a deep sea vnet.
  - Miller-Urey experiment in high pressure.
  - Pressure bombs - things can explode.
  - Model the environment of the deep sea vents in a small gold tube.
    - *nothing happened.*
  - Basic gasses (nitrogen, `CO2`), etc. 
    - Hold in a gold tube, but nothing happens.
  - Squeezing and heating had no effect.
- The spark kickstarts the chemistry.
  - It's missing the spark.
- Try putting rocks and minerals in.
  - Put in "early earth cocktail"
  - Run the experiment again.
  - Atoms reform into new organic molecules: **amino acids**.
- When powdered rocks and minerals are put in the capsules, organic molecules form.

### What is the Metabolism-First Hypothesis for the Origiin of Life?
- Mystery of the origin of life has not been solved.
  - Macromolecules: genes and proteins.
- **Cellular metabolism** - a sum total of all controlled chemical reactions that occur inside a cell.
  - Eat and digest an apple - bits are given to the bloodstream.
  - Cells' metabolism transforms food into new parts of the cell.
- Biological evolution (Darwinian evolution) can create highly complex structures and systems.
- **How can something make copies of itself and mutate?**
- Macromolecule-first Models: metabolism generated automatically.
  - Comes with formation of amino acids, chains, etc.
- First, needed to generate **building blocks**.
  - Produce junk along with amino acids.
    - Tar paradox
    - Looking at wrong conditions?
- Some aspect of modern metabolism must have existed *before* the macromolecules could have come.
  - If an ancient environment existed that was producing macromolecules, natural selection would favor any macromolecule that could enhance the environmental chemical reactions that produced its building blocks.
  - Widely shared traits are probably the oldest.
- Reverse Citric Acid Cycle
  - Found in microbes
  - Feeds on things like `CO2  and `H2`.
  - Very common in the early Earth.
  - Bind to produce larger pathways to build sugars, fats, and amino acids.
  - Avoiding tar paradox.
- Find a system that generates macromoelcuels from simple elements.
- **metabolism-first hypothesis**: some aspect of modern metabolism existed naturally in the environment before genes and proteins.

### What is the RNA World Hypothesis?
- Did chains of RNA exist first and kickstart life?
- Chains of RNA are found abundantly in all living cells.
  - Chemical cousin to DNA.
- RNA chains can replicate & evolve with their environments.
- RNA World Hypothesis: **Earth's chemistry was producing random chains of RNA. These began competing with each other for survival. Eventually formed living cells. Survival machines for RNA to live inside.
- Researchers find that base pairing lets RNA evolve.
- Template for its own replication.
  - Complementary strand is born with exact inverse sequence.
  - Water is heated; both chains are broken and act as templates.
  - Sometimes, mutations slip in; chains that compete for survival.
  - **True evolution can operate on chains of RNA.**
  - Base pairing gives RNA a special ability:
    - Water cool enough for base pairing but no enough nucleotides for pairing;
    - Chains will fold up and base pair with themselves sometimes.
    - Certain sticky bases point out can cause unique chemical reactions.
    - Many different shapes of RNA are **ribozymes**.
      - Some can join molecules together or split them apart.
      - Shape determined by sequence, shape determines function.
- How difficult would it be to develop survival functions?
  - Build nucleotides out of chemicals it ifnds in its environment?
  - Some randomly generated chains could randomly generate nucleotides.
  - PCR to generate random mutations.
  - Highly efficient ribozymes actively participate in their own survival.
  - Blur the line between living things and simple chemistry.
- **Unsolved question:** how did the backbone get put together?
  - Other molecules: self-assembling proto-RNA

### The RNA Origin of Life
- Map out evolution to single-celled life.
- DNA is a good way to store information but doesn't do much else.
- Cells rely on other molecules to survive.
- Proteins are good molecular machines, but cannot store information (need DNA).
- DNA needs protein to function, proteins need DNA to function.
- Answer: **RNA**.
  - RNA came first.
  - RNA can store information, or perform various functions.
- RNA World Hypothesis.
  - Billions of years ago, self-replicating RNA formed.
  - Self-replicating RNAs formed and developed.
