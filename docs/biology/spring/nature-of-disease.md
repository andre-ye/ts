### Shining Evolution's Light of Disease
- Immunizations are an important tool of modern medicine.
  - Protection is long-lasting for many diseases, or require redosage, like the flu.
- Repeated immunization to the flu: evolution of the influenza virus.
- *Evolution*: change in the heritable characteristics of a population over successive generations.

### How Does Influenza Evolve?
- Evolution cannot occur without a source of genetic variation - mutation.
- During an influenza infection, the flu reproduces itself; sometimes, an error occurs.
- Mutations give rise to new traits that can be advantageous.

### Spillovers, Reassortment, and Pandemics
- Human populations are not only plagued by annual outbreaks of seasonal influenza, but also by global influenza pandemics.
- Viral subtypes are given names based on the cahracteristics of their protein coats (H1N1, etc.)
  - Arises from a spillover from a wild animal population via reassortment.
  - *Reassortment* - two versions of the influenza virus infect a common host and swap RNA segmetns to produce a novel flu strain.
- Ebola, COVID-19, HIV/AIDS were all once restricted to animals before they spilled over to infect and spread through human populations.

### What Makes a Disease Successful?
- Many heritable traits that make pathogens successful are analogous to traits that aid non-pathogenic organisms.
- For the pathogen, advantage or disadvantage of a trait depends on interaction with the host.


### Evolution Favors the Optimal Level of Virulence
- Why do pathogens ever evolve to be harmful to their hosts?
- Harm caused to hosts by pathogens: *virulence*.
  - Pathogens *do* benefit from being virulent, but harm is a byproduct of infection, not a goal.
- Pathogens consume their host's resources to reproduce, and the host is inevitably harmed in the process.
- Virulent diuseases are expected to be more transmissable.
- Evolution by natural seelction is expected to favor intermediate virulence that maximizes the spread of the disease.
