## Introduction to Course

### Research Seminar
- What is research?
- What is the purpose of scholarship?

### Philosophy of Knowledge: Epistemology
- How can we generate knowledge?
  - I did a study, I can assert a statement.
- Why are we here?
  - Critical inquiry of refining a question to arrive at more profound, clear, and concise understandings of where we are.
  - Purpose, history.
- *To know thyself*.
  - Socrates is a Greek philosopher bieng persecuted for corrupting youth.
  - A trial; being interrogated about the purpose being his questions and teachings.
  - "The unexamined life is not worth living."
- In what ways can we know ourselves?
  - *Biological sense* - physiology, ecological. What is the nature of existence?
  - *Mental sense* - thoughts, pyschology, feelings.
  - *Social sense* - relationships, history.
- Knowing Thyself is not just individual, but about relationships - when we look inward, we also look outward.
- What is knowledge? What does it mean to know?
- The meaning of life - to better understand ourselves as individuals and as a collective.
- Two leading traditions in how we come to believe in something:
  - Empiricism - notion that we produce knowledge based on observations, sensation, recording.
  - Rationality - we can generate truth not from observation, but from our concious thought: reason, logic, mathematics.
- Harding's Feminist Standpoint Theory: knowledge is socially situated.

### Why Are We Here?
Purpose of research and of our being here, of understanding, of looking through the lens of better understandings:
1. Empiricism: knowledge from observation
2. Rationality: knowledge from internal thought, logic
3. The Individual: biological, internal, and social
4. Context: environment, society, history

### Why Research?
- Ultimately, trying to understand something about the world.
- A process to better know oneself, or/and the world.
- A process of self-discovery as much an inquiry about the weorld around us.

| Helps us... | Questions |
| --- | --- |
| answer questions of human existence | Why are we here? What is knowledge? |
| better understand ourselves | Who are we? What are relationships between ourselves and the world? |
| solve pratical problems | How does this phenomenon work? |

- Harding's feminist standpoint theory
  - Context of Discovery: how does context influence our questions?
  - Logic of Inquiry: foundational assumptions and understandings that shape our work
  - A Process of Achievement: not inherent to fixed positions

### Research Seminar
- 15-18 page research paper on a topic and question of your choosing
  - In the spirit of "know thyself", your choice should be a topic/issue/question you are personally interested/curious/concerned about.
- Research process:
  1. Select a topic
  2. Formulate a question
  3. Propose a hypothesis
  4. Read/research the literature
  5. Refine your claim
  6. Write your paper
  7. Revise

## Introduction to Research

### Navigate
- [Introduction to Research Recap](#introduction-to-research-recap)
- [Active Reading: Discerning Argumentation in Complex Texts](#active-reading-discerning-argumentation-in-complex-texts)
  * [A Structure to Understand Complex Tests](#a-structure-to-understand-complex-tests)
- [Prospectus Writing](#prospectus-writing)
  * [Purpose of a Paper Prospectus](#purpose-of-a-paper-prospectus)
  * [Elements of a Paper Prospectus](#elements-of-a-paper-prospectus)
  * [Focused Topic](#focused-topic)
  
### Introduction to Research Recap
- Epistemological foundations for social science research.
  - Know Thyself: empiricism and rationalism
- Developing a research plan for a long research paper
  - Generating a focused topic
  - Writing a prospectus
- Standpoint theory
  - What is Harding's argument?



### Active Reading: Discerning Argumentation in Complex Texts
- In research, one will encounter advanced texts; some texts people base entire careers on.
  - Struggling with texts is natural.

#### A Structure to Understand Complex Tests
- Sumo wrestling with complex texts.
- What are the laws and rules of engagement?
- Getting in contact with the text.
- Central tasks to uncovering arguments in complex texts - assumes standard methods don't work.
  - Structure: what is the purpose of each section?
  - Central Question: can we reverse engineer the central question?
  - What is the "they say"? What is the counter claim?
  - Alternate resources: ask, research, collaborate
  - Stakes: what is the significance of the intervention?
- This approach can help.

### Prospectus Writing

#### Purpose of a Paper Prospectus
- Mental outline of large conceptual work
- Breaks work into discrete chunks
- Think through and articulate some of your expectations
- A prospectus is a *contract with yourself*.

#### Elements of a Paper Prospectus
- Focused topic
- Preliminary research question
- Framework / theory - need to engage with this; an approach or lens used to approach the subject.
- Hypothesis
- Literature
- Plan for completion

#### Focused Topic
- Specifies the interest
- Specifies the actors
- Specifies the action
- Gives context for the intervention
- Go big or go home; vagaries banished to the ether! Greater specificity allows for greater success.

#### Preliminary Research Question
- Not the central question for the finished essay; just a step into the field.
- Should express curiosity.
- Follow what is the most interesting for you.
- Initial question can be both factual and conceptual, but there needs to be a conceptual component at least.
- Ground it in a specific text - source of interest? Newspapers, theories, readings from last quarter.

#### Framework
- How will you look at your topic?
- A way to simplify and abstract your topic/question
 - Economic or ideological? Gender or class?
- Theory is a specific method, analysis, insight to be applied to your topic.
 - Not expected to have theory yet
 - Must be appropriate to topic


### Elements
#### Hypothesis
- More like expectations: what do you think is likely here? What do you expect to find? Why?

#### Literature
- Research as much as possible. Point to specific articles, authors, and ideas to use.
- Point to a broad field and possible avenues.
 - Want to use feminist literature on economics.
 - Explore how political scientists talk about the great crash.

## Week 3

### Navigate
- [From Topic to Questions](#from-topic-to-questions)
- [Bibliography](#bibliography)
- [Annotated Bibliography](#annotated-bibliography)
  * [Writing Up from the Sources](#writing-up-from-the-sources)
  * [Letting Sources Structure Your Essay](#letting-sources-structure-your-essay)
  * [Use Your Bibliography to Maximum Effect](#use-your-bibliography-to-maximum-effect)
  * [Appropriate Sources for an Academic Essay](#appropriate-sources-for-an-academic-essay)


### From Topic to Questions
- The question is central to the process
- Without a question, the project lacks direction.
- How do you move from a generalized interest and develop it into a question?
- The research question should drive what you bring to your projects.
  - Be curious about the world.
  - Focus around a very specific claim.
  - Use skills generated by our analysis.
  - Need curiosity - listen to your curiosity.
- When researching:
  - Limit your variables
  - Define and set boundaries
  - Ask conceptual questions
  - Look for ultimate causality.

### Bibliography 
- Foundational work for academic argumentation.
- You cannot produce material without engaging with texts on an evidentiary basis.


### Annotated Bibliography
- Help orient you to a field of research literature quickly so you can get a grasp of the contours - what is it people are saying? Where do I fit in? What is it I am trying to say?
- Purpose of annotated bibliographies:
  - Get to know the field/scope of the debate
  - Identify key sources and touchstones of literature
  - Prioritize elements of the field
  - Better understand specific texts
  - Provide an outline for the project.

#### Writing Up from the Sources
- Social sciences are an empirical tradition; embedded in positivist thinking.
- Notion that the way we know the world is through evidence.
- Papers can be structured entirely from source work.
  - Sources allow us to make claims, our work should be organized by sources.
  - *Write up from the text*, much like in TS History Reading Responses.

#### Letting Sources Structure Your Essay

| Structure | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Hook | Novel, personal story |
| They Say | Prominent scholarship |
| Theory | Activist doc., philosophy |
| Evidence | Empirical study, scholarship, analysis |
| Conclusions | Scholarship, political documents, news |

- Anything you say must be evidenced by sources.
- Look at all sorts of pieces.

#### Use Your Bibliography to Maximum Effect
- What will I need to say? Where/how can I find it?
- Look for a diversity of sources; most academic but not all.
  - "Color sources" - empirical, theoretical.
- Look at many more sources than you will use.

#### Appropriate Sources for an Academic Essay
- No inappropriate sources, only inappropriate uses.
- Use a majority of scholarly sources.
  - Sources published by the academic press
  - Peer-reviewed academic journal
  - Government or other methodologically rigorous studies
- Non-traditional sources are also acceptable if used appropriately.
- Ways to identify source types
  - Author
  - Publisher
  - Audience
  - Content
  - Use - how you read it
 
#### Looking and Individual Entries
- Books - you don't need to look at the entire book. Look at what is particularly helpful.


### Evaluating a Source
#### Determining if a Source Will Be Useful
- Ask questions of your sources: what are you looking for - what do you need?
- Will this source have it?
 - Contextual reading - title, publisher, connection
 - Skim - abstract, intro, core section, book review
 - Index search - does it have what you're looking for?
- Is it reliable? How can I use it?

#### Placing a Source in Your Bibliography
- What are you using the source for?
- Time for a close reading.
 - Main argument or subclaim.
  - Read that section in detail - skip other extraneous material.
- Data, concepts, anecdotes. Read only the section you need. Extract data via tables, graphs, etc.

#### Recap
- Evaluate for initial/deeper reads.
- What information am I looking for?
- Evaluate for use:
 - Does this relate?
 - What does this do for my claim?
 - Can I analyze, use, quote this?

## Week 4

### Recap from Bibliography Work
- **You cannot say anything without sources.**
- Find the types of sources that enable you to say what you want to say.
- There are *no* inappropriate source.


### Thinking with Theory
- What is social theory?
- Inquiries into the unknowable
- Theories: frameworks, paradigms, concepts, use to analyze and understand social phenomena
- Exploring the complex and the "unknowable"
  - abstract and simplify complex phenomena
  - provide a lens of analysis for new insights


### A History of Theory
- Social theory emerges with modernity.

#### Medieval
- Machiavelli - the Prince
  - Statecraft
  - Politics
  - This is how state politics works if you want to maintain power and develop projects of your interest.

#### 17th Century
- End of feudalism
- Rise of capitalism
  - Resource extraction, profit making - tranformational in how people think of themselves.
- Enlightenment and humanism
  - Reawakening of human understanding; both humanistic (human focused, not divine) and scientific.
- Scientific revolution
  - Sets of knowledge that set European societies off in new directions.
- Connection to Americas


#### 18th Century
- Locke - *Two Treatises on Government*
  - Argues for industrious use, a natural right for property.
  - Develops into a system of slavery.
  - The purpose of government is to protect property.
  - Clearly a political project; he is generating a new theory of society based on forms of social organization.
- Montesquieu - *The Spirit of Laws*
  - Despotism, monarchy, republics.
  - What is happening in Europe and the rest of the world?
  - Why are there different types of social organization?
    - If we can categorize into different categories, why are there disparities?
  - The spirit is made of climate, geography, culture.
  - Is writing at the birth of nation-states (France, England, Great Britain). Notion of trans-historic geographic cultural spirit is foundational to concepts of nation.
    - How do we define and justify ourselves as a people?
    - We have a distinct *spirit* separate from other sets of people.
- Rousseau - *Discourse on Inequality*
  - Asking not about government (although partially) but about other types of social transformation that are happening in the 17th and 18th centuries.
  - Central question surrounding inequality. If government is being produced to justify property, why is there not a greater degree of equality?
  - Why is social distinction and hierarchy so embedded in European culture?
  - Argues for "The State of Nature"; natural hierarchies (physical differences) vs social hierarchies.
- Smith - *The Wealth of Nations*
- **People are positing different types of answers about how society functions.**
- Unprovable causal explanations for how these things happen that can only be posited as theory; trying to answer the unknowable.
- Isolate part of the complex emerging social hold.

#### Modern Social Theory
- Fields of sociology, political science, economics
  - Comte
  - Foucault - discourse, deeply embedded and inescapable structures of power. Society is a form of discipline, surveillance, and public. What ideas do people hold?
  - Marx - positing theories of class revolutions under the guise of nationalism.
  - Butler - most famous feminist theoist currently; gender and sex as social constructs.
  - Mills 
  - Said - colonialism.
  - Weber
  - Chomsky - social power, anarchism, linguistics.
- Sharing transcendent qualities
- Social change emerged as too complex
  - Montesquieu - climate and culture produces the spirit of society in law
  - Rousseau and Smith - look to economics, private property, to explain social change
- Why are national revolutions emerging in this new way?

#### Readings for Week 4
- Race: W.E.B. Du Bois. Interested in why white people keep identifying as white people and what creates hostility. "Pyschological wage".
- Gender: Simone de Beauvoir. Foundational for a series of other later social thinkers, including Edward Said and others. Concept of otherness, relations of the other.
- Class: Louis Althusser. Thinking about how ideas are material, economic, and are structured. "Ideological State Apparatus".

## Week 5

### Introduction
- Not only thinking about how we write, but the process by which we go about constructing writing.



### Drafting and Planning
- Transition from exploration to drafting and planning.
- Planning is developing a conceptual map of the entire project to facilitate writing.
- Thinking specifically about segments of the project - what do they look like, even if you don't have them?


### Elements in a Plan
```
- Introduction
- Review / setup
- Claim / evidence
- Implications
- Conclusion
```

- Having a broad conception of main conlusions you want is important.
- Getting more fine-grained.

```
- Hook
- Central question
- Thesis / hypothesis
- Field literature review / they say
- Theory source
- Claim, evidence, source, purpose
- Personal account and interest
- Implications for the field
- Implications for the universe - politics, philosophy, policy, humanity.
- Conclusions - new interest - hook.
```


### Drafting
- Start writing a section; choose the most compelling evidence, then write up your analysis.
- Allow the process to change your plan.
- What problem have you encountered? What is an analysis of what is happening? Does it bring you to new conclusions?

### Introduction
- Impacts of human-caused climate change; some have labeled the geologic epoch in which we live the "Anthropocene" - defined by human impacts on the planet.
- Human carbon emissions have been accelerating.

### Second Industrial Revolution
- Important marker of climate change.
- Distinguished by the usage of fossil fuels from water-powered (and other forms) to wood, then coal.
  - Made all of the production, transportation, etc. possible.
  - Power plants and factories were powered by coal.
- Coal became an important product; coal is very carbon-rich, which is why it burns and emits pollution.
- Oil begins to rival coal.
- 1912, a crucial decision made by the British Navy overseen by Winston Churchill: shifted power source of ships from coal to oil.
  - British military might was now dependent on oil.
  - Facilitated a process of military conquest and expansion.
  - Military institutions are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide today.
- Ties capitalist growth and expansion with state power.
- About half of carbon emissions are from petroleum use. Had a dramatic impact.

### Global Cooling and the Arrhenius Equation
- What are the changes in the natural world being caused by?
- A long period of debate and negotiation attempting to pinpoint the cause of rising global temperatures.
- Temperatures have not been continually rising.
- Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist, attempted to answer the question of global cooling.
- Many cycles of cooling periods in which there could be glacial expansion.
- Earth's orbital tilt, activities on the sun... what are climactic conditions themself not being the result of but a causal agent in periods of glacial expansion.
- Arrhenius was attempting to measure the infrared radiation reflected from the moon.
  - Comes up with the Arrhenius equation.
  - Energy diffusion in fluid dynamics of the atmosphere can be measured.
  - Found warming to be good for climate cooling.

### 1938 Callendar Confirmation
- Many believed that other sources of cooling contributed to climate change, rather than Arrhenius' proposal.
- Controlled environment absorption studies found that there was a limit to how much radiation carbon could absorb.
- Atmospheric radiation could reach a saturation level.
- Later, Guy Callendar confirmed Arrhenius's work.
  - Performed calculations; looked at data from weather observation and calculated before computers the emission of carbon into the atmosphere.
- There did appear to be a correlation between increasing temperatures and emissions.
- Callendar continued to publish scientific papers, arguing for a correlation, eventually convinced that this was causal.
- However, Callendar was isolated; the British meteorologist disputed his claims.


### World War II
- Saw a significant increase in the industrial capacity of the globe.
- Modern warfare is based on the total mobilization of society.
- All the industrial capacity a society can produce must be brought to the fore.
- The ability to produce large amounts of oil-consuming mechanisms.
- Expansive productive growth: these are all petrol-based in their continued use and maintenance.
- New concerns around political economy continued to grow; government contracts to firms like Boeing help to support economic growth.

### Keeling and Postwar Science
- Postwar science was inconclusive concerning these problems.
- It was not clear that carbon was causing these things, or that it was significant enough to overcome other phenomena.
- More scientists in the 1950s and 60s (still a minority) began to become convinced that there was a causal relationship between the two.
- An emerging consensus.


### Nuclear Science
- Debates over atom energy and the use of atomic weapons.
- The atom energy program in the United States comes out of military necessity around creating atomic weapons.
- Manhattan project pursued by the United States.
- The United States government began to produce a series of propaganda pieces about the civilian uses of atomic technologies.
- Notoriously difficult to contain. A half-life of plutonium is something beyond the comprehension of how humans can maintain control.
- Other troubling elements:
  - Initial atomic tests were happening in the Pacific ocean in places like the Bikini Atoll.
  - Blasts led to deep-sea fishermen becoming radiated from the nuclear fallout that they were dying.
  - United States was performing above-ground testing in places like Nevada and New Mexico.
    - Dozens of experimental nuclear blasts.
    - People in the region would see the flashes of light.
  - A growing movement of critical scientists / counterhegemonic scientists.
    - Studies the impact of radioactive fallout on humans.
- Politicization of science.

### Emissions and Movements
- By the 60s and into the 70s, there emerged movements of scientists who are writing about the impact humans have on their environment.
- Climate is not the major concern, but radiation and other forms of chemical contamination are.
- Putting forward different values through science.
- Mass movements are emerging, with a focus on pollution.
- Led to the limiting of particle pollutants into the atmosphere.
- Particulate matter was declining, but climate emissions were unchecked.


### Science in the 1980s
- Internal studies regarding the relation of carbon emissions to global warming are performed.
- Humans have a tremendous and very troubling impact on the environment.


### UN Process and the Creation of the IPCC
- Begin to propose policy proposals and protocols.
- Kyoto Protocol and Paris Accords.
