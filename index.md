# TS Notes

Notes from the Robinson Center's Transition School Program.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

[ðŸ¡  Explore Notes](){: .btn }

I'm Andre Ye. I'm a current student at the University of Washington pursuing dual study in Computer Science and Philosophy. I was granted admission into the UW through the Early Entrance Program; I attended Transition School during the 2020-2021 school year. This website stores my notes and work from the intense but incredibly rewarding year.

The [Transition School](https://robinsoncenter.uw.edu/programs/transition-school/){:target="_blank"} is a one-year college preparatory program offered through the [Robinson Center for Young Scholars](https://robinsoncenter.uw.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Washington via the Early Entrance Program (EEP). Students leave eighth grade into the Transition School, from which they graduate and become matriculated college students.

**If you're a current or former TS student** and are introduced in contributing your notes, reach out to me at `andreye@uw.edu` for possibilities of collaboration. I'm looking to convert this site from a personal project into a wide-ranging repository for TS notes and content, if there are people willing to work with me to that end.
